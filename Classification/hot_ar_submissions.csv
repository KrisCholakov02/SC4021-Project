Here are Omdia's insights on the recently reported cancellation of Apple's microLED display programme

* Apple's Micro LED display technology is RGB separate LED on TFT with Micro IC integrated. The cost simulation on 2.13-inch 540x440 resolution with over 900,000 LEDs of Omdia shows it is in more than 2X of the cost with other Micro LED display, and more than 3X cost of the current OLED.

* It is a cost and balance thing. See current high-end Smart Watch with OLED (such as Apple Watch #Ultra, #hermes Apple watch, Tag Heuer's #E4Golf, Gamin's #MARQ in terms of brightness, power consumption, robustness...) it is ""good enough"" for these high-end feature. Micro LED display can push these watches to another high-end but the question will be the extreme high cost addition can be accepted by these brands/OEMs/Consumers.

* Apple may delay or cancel its Micro LED smart watch plan because of the current Micro LED technology is not ready sufficiently with cost and economics. But the R&D of Micro LED continues. Apple may try again on Micro LED display for Apple watch in the next five years, if the other Micro LED technology (such as without Micro IC or RGB stacked LED) is getting more readiness. Apple is certainly still in a strong needs for technology and features differentiation.

* Certainly it is not the end of Micro LED display, but it will diminish the Micro LED display forecast in Smart Watch application, while the other Micro LED display technology for AR/VR/XR applications, automotive display, transparent interface display and large screen TV/public display are getting ready to commercialize from now. Micro LED display market prospects are still promising but it will be adjusted accordingly. #omdia will report the new adjustment in https://lnkd.in/gDdEtFaz

* For a new display technology with better feature but high cost, it is certain that the supply chain driving is not enough to grow, it needs a ""strong"" brand/OEM to adopt it, endorse it and promote it (to the end users). This will be critical for the future development of Micro LED display in different applications - TV, auto, AR/VR, Smartwatch....

My usecase is pretty basic, but I believe not the common one 

I want AR glasses *only* for gaming, I won't use them for anything else but.

I already own VR headsets, but I want something more comfortable for flat gaming sessions, and for traveling

I will use it for Steam Deck, PC and PS5, wired (I do have a good TV, but it is sometimes taken). A *must* for me is 3dof in a sense the screen is in a fixed location, and not fixed to my display.

So far my google research has lead me to believe the xreal 2 air/pro are the best for my use case, combined with a Beam for the 3DOF. However, I read the Beam adds latency which might suck

Having said that, I'm not playing shooters. Mostly ARPG, platformers etc.. so 5-10 extra ms won't kill me, I assume

samus1225,1709525425.0,,1b61jio,t3_1b61jio,5,1,"Hi everyone! First of all, I'm not a developer. I'm a high school science teacher. I know enough programming to pass the AP computer programming test with a 3 back in 2005 and I know enough to coach robotics and teach the students How to code for Vex and drones 

That being said, it's always been a dream of mine to learn how to create a video game and when I saw the metaquest 3 and it's price point I immediately bought one. I now want to learn how to develop augmented reality games and apps. 

My old desktop died a few months ago and I've been procrastinating building a new one. She was the best bang for my buck back in 2015 when I built her: AMD FX 8 core 4 GHz and GTX 970. 4 gigs of ram. Friend later gave me a 1070 when he upgraded to a 3070. I have an HTC Vive and it runs about as well as you would expect. Or rather it did run that well because my PC is now dead. 

I'm now at a crossroads. I absolutely want to get into augmented reality and start to incorporate it into my classroom somehow. I want to make games. I want to start learning the skills needed to develop the ideas that I have.

I want a laptop. I'm at that stage my life where I just want a good laptop. Yes I do want to build a new desktop, but logistically speaking, I would benefit better from a laptop at this point in my life. 

I also don't want to spend that much money.

I also have been seeing across the internet that laptops just aren't good enough for augment reality just yet. 

I found what I believe to be a fairly decent laptop within my price range. It even has a 4070 you.

 My question is: is this worth my time or waste of money? Should I spring for a more expensive laptop or should I just bite the bullet and build a new desktop?

I want to play my mobile games without having to hold my phone and do everything on the phone! 
Games I play are war dragons, marvel strike force, qin empire, tower of God, reincarnated as a slime. 
True mobile games not ps or Xbox sharing. 
So I want to use a pair of ar glasses to share the screen to make it larger and then perform the needed actions with the hand tracking feature. So basically the areas on the game that you would tap on the phone for an action you can now tap the spot on the ar screen with your finger.

This is ultimately what I'd like to find. I have Multiple Sclerosis so trying to hold my phone to play games on it is very difficult. 

I honestly wouldn't be opposed to a controller that could be attached to the phone as well to do the same thing (example like something similar to a ps5 controller) I have not found anything like this that works with normal mobile games, only ones that work with ps and Xbox sharing type of games. 

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. 

Just encase this information is necessary for answering my question. 
I am an android user. My phone is the Galaxy s24 Ultra, I also have a Galaxy Fold 4 that I have been using more so lately due to the larger screen size.

LeBienfaitDeLaLune,1709208437.0,,1b2yso1,t3_1b2yso1,1,0,"Designing user interfaces demands a nuanced understanding of where digital and physical realms merge. Menus play a pivotal role in defining the user experience. Adopting contextual and nested menus emerges as a crucial strategy for UX designers aiming to refine interaction within AR, VR, and MR environments.

Contextual Menus: These dynamic menus adjust based on the user's current state or the object or scene with which they interact. By offering options immediately pertinent to the user's task, contextual menus reduce cognitive load and streamline the user's workflow.

Nested Menus: This organisational strategy groups related features or properties into hierarchical categories akin to folders on a PC. Nested menus help manage complexity by enabling users to delve into specific categories without being overwhelmed by choices from the outset.

The Rationale for Contextual and Nested Design

In Spatial Computing, where users navigate and interact within three-dimensional spaces, the necessity for intuitive and accessible menus is paramount. Here's why implementing contextual and nested menus is vital:

\- Decluttering the Experience: Spatial environments can quickly overload information. Contextual menus display only the options relevant to the user's current context, and nested menus organise options logically, reducing visual clutter and focusing the user's attention on the task at hand.

\- Guiding User Actions: Through contextual menus, designers can subtly direct users towards the most relevant actions at any moment, enhancing usability and ensuring a smoother interaction flow.

\- Facilitating Modular User Journeys: Nested menus allow for a modular approach to user journeys, breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps. This organisation aids users in navigating the system more efficiently, making the experience more enjoyable and less daunting.

Implementing Contextual and Nested Menus

When crafting spatial experiences, consider the following strategies to implement contextual and nested menus effectively:

\- Analyse User Tasks and Contexts: Begin by outlining the tasks users will undertake and the various contexts they may encounter. This analysis will guide your menu design, ensuring it meets users' needs at every juncture.

\- Prioritise Content: Determine which options are crucial in each context and which can be nested for later access. This prioritisation aids in creating a menu system that is both comprehensive and unobtrusive.

\- Design for Intuition: Menus should be intuitively designed, with clear labels and logical groupings. Users should be able to anticipate where to find specific options based on their current context or task.

\- Iterate and Test: User testing should refine contextual and nested menu design. Observing real users navigate and utilise these menus can provide invaluable insights, helping to fine-tune the interface for optimal usability.

Conclusion

The strategic categorisation and nesting of menus in Spatial Computing interfaces represent a potent approach to enhancing UX. By tailoring menu options to the user's context and organising features in a logical hierarchy, designers can craft experiences that are not only more intuitive and efficient but also more engaging.

As Spatial Computing progresses, contextual and nested design principles will undoubtedly play a crucial role in its evolution, smoothly guiding users through the expanding digital landscape.",Contextual and Nested Menus,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/augmentedreality/comments/1b2yso1/contextual_and_nested_menus/

We introduce Genie, a foundation world model trained from Internet videos that can generate an endless variety of playable (action-controllable) worlds from synthetic images, photographs, and even sketches.

A Foundation Model for Playable Worlds

The last few years have seen an emergence of generative AI, with models capable of generating novel and creative content via language, images, and even videos. Today, we introduce a new paradigm for generative AI, generative interactive environments (Genie), whereby interactive, playable environments can be generated from a single image prompt. 

Genie can be prompted with images it has never seen before, such as real world photographs or sketches, enabling people to interact with their imagined virtual worlds-‚Äìessentially acting as a foundation world model. This is possible despite training without any action labels. Instead, Genie is trained from a large dataset of publicly available Internet videos. We focus on videos of 2D platformer games and robotics but our method is general and should work for any type of domain, and is scalable to ever larger Internet datasets.

Let's dive into the art of crafting soundscapes that not only set the mood but actively guide and respond to user interactions.  


A soundscape, the auditory layer of your experience, is built on two main components:

1. Spatial Audio Source - This gives life to your 3D environment, allowing precise placement of sounds that add depth and realism.
2. Ambient Sound - It shapes the scene's mood with stereo/binaural audio, enriching your design without needing spatialisation.

The showcase demonstrates how to integrate various MR features including Scene API, Shared Spatial Anchors, Colocation, Passthrough, and Passthrough Color Mapping. We leverage Interaction SDK to demonstrate best practices on how to interact with the elements in the scene through various puzzles. The full source code is now available on GitHub making Cryptic Cabinet the perfect way for developers to explore the potential of mixed reality on Meta Quest.
Mixed reality puzzles that adapt to any room layout

Mixed reality experiences are often better when they interact and blend in with the user‚Äôs real world surroundings. But building MR experiences that adapt to every user‚Äôs unique space is a challenge for many developers. We developed Cryptic Cabinet to showcase how developers can create an MR experience that is tailored to each player‚Äôs room. In Cryptic Cabinet, the experience begins with a mysterious cabinet appearing in the room. When the cabinet opens, the room fills with more cryptic items and the player needs to decipher how to use the items correctly to return the cabinet to its rightful owner.

In order for every user to have a great MR experience, items need to be placed optimally in any room based on the layout provided during the mixed reality space setup. Cryptic Cabinet adapts the position of the puzzles based on the location of the walls, floor, ceiling, and furniture so the experience is customized to the user‚Äôs playspace.

""What tools and systems will streamline the spatial computing creation pipeline?""

Advances in semantic understanding, object recognition, depth detection, and machine learning are needed to create tools that empower developers to prototype in a spatial context instead of current pipelines that require creators to transition between 3D creator tools and 3D game engines.

""How will we personalize experiences to accommodate a wide range of abilities?""

By understanding the context and environment in which people are using applications, we can dynamically modify the scale and location of interactive content relative to a person's needs. A combination of voice controls, wearables, and configurable UI are needed to adapt the application to fit each individual's preferences. Hard-coded components interfere with the ability to scale testing and reduce the amount of actionable feedback from a variety of demographics.

""How will the diverse set of capabilities provided by adjacent technologies advance mixed-reality?""

How can we use physiological, gestural, and biometric data to both determine the effectiveness of VR and to drive immersive experiences? How will the blending of quantitative data, informed with insights from qualitative interpretation, emphasize user-determined creativity?

Providing the high-resolution AR image under FOV angle from 6~42 degrees and the VID of 3~50 meters are the leading spotting lights of FIC AR HUD. Seven algorithms are designed to integrate with the road and traffic environment, combining the virtual and the reality together to make driving safe and convenient.

In addition to navigation, vehicle speed, vehicle information, and ADAS information, FIC AR HUD includes driver monitoring systems and driver behavior systems, to enhance the safety of the driving experience. FIC Laser AR HUD is on the road to advanced AR HUD and plans ahead to become the portal of the In-Vehicle Metaverse.

Car manufacturers have also widely applied AR HUD technology, making it a standard feature in most new vehicles. The popularity of AR HUD allows more drivers to enjoy the various benefits it brings. Car designs have become more stylish and futuristic, and drivers take pride in owning a vehicle equipped with AR HUD.

The development of AR HUD technology opens up further possibilities for the future driving experience. With continuous technological innovations, AR HUD designs will become more refined, and compact, while offering higher image resolutions and realism. Additionally, AR HUD will further evolve in terms of intelligent interaction features such as voice recognition, gesture control, and eye-tracking, enabling more intelligent and convenient interactions between drivers and HUD.

FIC AR HUD is uniquely designed based on the LBS technology, which brings up high contrast, high brightness, and low power consumption. The AR images projected through the device give great clarity under multiple driving situations, such as direct sunlight, night, cloudy, heavy fog, and even on a rainy day.

I wrote this post originally for LinkedIn audience and porting it here, so has a lot of enterprise lingo in there, but tried to make it fun:

Here's the Magic Leap 2 unboxing with some legends in their prospective fields.

In the ring tonight - We have:

‚ú® Arguably, pound for pound, the most immersive AR enterprise heavy(lightest device on the market, at 260g)weight champion of the world, the one and only [Magic Leap](https://www.magicleap.com), with their latest headset, the ML2.

The ML2 is a true augmented reality device - it lays digital content right on top of the real world through transparent optics, it does not need passthrough cameras to recycle them photons on screens - oh, no - photons hit direct to eye. This means content is integrated into user's view where and when it is needed.

Purpose-built & bred for enterprise use, its open platform and industry-leading technology and features are designed to run transformative enterprise solutions.

This is by far the easiest device to wear, users adapt immediately with little training, and there is absolutely little chance of any motion sickness (unless you're the competition in the ring). It's cameras and ToF sensor generate over 300,000 precise 3D points to map your environment down to the millimeter. Tiny & mighty with:

üöÄ 4x Eye Tracking Cameras
üî• 14 core computer vision processing engine (CVIP)
‚úîÔ∏è 120 Hz refresh rate (blink & the ML2 is there)
üõ∏ 70¬∞ diagonal #FOV

And YES, persistent spatial mapping + Dynamic Dimming technology makes AR content more legible & solid across a variety of lighting conditions.

Our champion is home brewed & manufactured in Florida, welcome to the new era of industry-grade #spatialcomputing.

‚ú®In the immediate starting corner, due middle, we have Maarten Witteveen, the the co-founder & president of North America of [Manus](https://manus-vr.com/). Manus develops the world's best data gloves for use in real-time XR & motion capture. Their latest, the Quantum Metagloves has introduced a new magnetic tracking approach, offering unparalleled accurate finger tracking, especially when it comes to fingertip interactions either for picking up small objects in VR or with physical objects such as props or mixed reality tools. Watch out for the sun-millimeter precise hook.

‚ú®Following the Netherlands based Manus w/ their famous orange team colors, is the talented Royce Adkins, director & digital creator of fun & educational content using the latest in motion capture. He is a master of mocap, utilizing the latest in full body tracking by Xsens, & some wizardry using the Manus gloves. Check him out on [YT](https://youtube.com/@rorobeckley?si=9LAHUSJB5ElurX6m)

Hi everyone, I have a question about creating an augmented reality experience for a concert. My goal is to allow users to scan a trigger and then engage with the AR experience on their mobile devices. Through this, I want to be able to control certain elements of the experience and push updates out to all the connected devices. 

In the AR experience on the mobile devices, I envision having 3D objects in a shared space that are synced to the music, similar to the [Gorillaz performance in NYC](https://youtu.be/Vqq-eD4aOM8?t=13). The devices would all show the same shared environment that reacts to the music.

Does anyone have suggestions or advice for the best way to architect and build an AR experience like this that can be synchronized across many devices simultaneously? I'm open to any recommendations on platforms, SDKs, or technical approaches. Any help is much appreciated! 

FYI: this isn‚Äôt a solo project is for a class and we have a couple developers on board so we are looking for any sort of direction in deployment. ",AR Concert Concert Development,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/augmentedreality/comments/1avn0of/ar_concert_concert_development/

I work for a parking technology company and I‚Äôm looking for an innovative way to do product demonstrations virtually to a potential customer, anywhere in the world.

We have parking meters, gated equipment, pay stations, EV Charging stations, license plate recognition (LPR) integrations, parking guidance systems.

We also have software platforms such as BI dashboard tools (where all your parking technology data gets pooled into), a mobile parking solution (+app), parking reservations solution, permit management solution and more‚Ä¶

Currently, we have our potential clients come down to our mock parking space and watch us push buttons and explain how everything works, plus how the system works as a whole.

My team and I were looking into how to use AR and/or VR to conduct these product demonstrations; however from what I see online, the only option is to do a simulation of a single product as a projection into their environment, which is not quite what we want. I‚Äôm looking for a way to showcase not only how to use the individual product (e.g. pay station) but also how it works as a system with its counterparts (i.e. how you can take a paid ticket from the pay station and use it to exit at the exit gate: enter the same ticket at the exit terminal, gate goes up, you drive out).

Is there any technology out there where a potential client can interact with these systems virtually in the comfort of their office and test out the various technology systems we have to offer?

1. Vision Pros: User Feedback and Returns
2. Mozilla Hubs Shutdown
3. AR in Sports: NFL, MLB, and PGA Apps
4. EmdoorVR's Market Entry
5. AR Transforming Spinal Surgery  


## People are apparently returning their Vision Pros

Thread: Less than two weeks after people got their hands on the Vision Pros, social media has been seeing several posts on them returning their headsets.

The strands:

* Some early adopters had decided to make use of the 14-day window to return their $3,500 spatial computing headset
* It was often very uncomfortable to wear for a lot of people because it was loaded at the front, straining the back of the head where the straps went.
* The usual complaints of motion sickness and headaches were also seen, which VR headset users have been reporting for years.
* Most who returned it just didn‚Äôt think the Vision Pro was ready for the mass market, and felt that later iterations could impress them.

What it means:

After Zuckerberg‚Äôs thoughts on how the Vision Pro felt, more of the general public are coming out with the same set of gripes. Early adopters are of the opinion that the Vision Pro could get better later when they perfect the formula.

## Mozilla Hubs Is Shutting Down

Thread:

Mozilla has decided to end support for their WebXR based experience, Mozilla Hubs. They are looking to hand over the platform to its community.

The strands:

* Mozilla Hubs was one of the biggest virtual 3D worlds on WebXR.
* The demo servers, subscriptions and community resources will be shut down on May 31, 2024.
* The open source project is going to be kept alive by the community, with all the avatars, scenes and other Mozilla published assets going open source.

What it means:

One of the biggest WebXR experiences going open source means that there is a big opportunity for the community or even another company to pick up and give it another go.

Vision Pro Gets a Sporting Chance:

Thread: Major sports leagues ‚Äî NFL, MLB, and PGA ‚Äî have unveiled apps for the new Apple Vision Pro headset.

The Strands:

* These leagues are pioneering the integration of AR with sports fandom.
* The move represents a major test for AR tech in a mass consumer market.
* Fans get a new, immersive way to experience sports, promising a richer engagement.

What It Means: The quick adoption by major sports leagues signals a strong belief in AR's potential to revolutionize fan engagement. However, as this technology is still in its infancy, these developments serve as a real-world litmus test for AR's readiness for mainstream markets. The leagues' commitment may drive innovation and improvements, potentially setting a precedent for future AR applications in various industries.

## EmdoorVR Takes on Apple with Vision Pro Look-Alike

Thread: EmdoorVR, a Chinese startup, is stepping into the spotlight with an AR device that closely resembles Apple's Vision Pro, aiming to offer a competitive alternative at a more accessible price point.

The Strands:

* The company is targeting the burgeoning AR market with its cost-effective solution.
* By mimicking the design and functionality of the Vision Pro, EmdoorVR is positioning itself as a formidable contender in the AR space.

What It Means: EmdoorVR's approach highlights the intensifying competition in AR technology, potentially accelerating innovation and making AR more accessible to a broader audience.

## Revolutionizing Spinal Surgery with Augmented Reality

Thread: Surgeons are now using augmented reality (AR) technology to perform spinal surgeries with increased precision, safety, and efficiency.

The Strands:

* AR allows real-time visualization of the patient's anatomy and surgical tools, directly overlaid on the surgical field.
* This tech is paving the way for less invasive procedures, potentially reducing recovery times and complications.
* Early adopters report significant improvements in surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction.

What It Means: The integration of AR into spinal surgery is a major leap forward, promising a future where surgeries are safer, faster, and more precise. This could set new standards for surgical practices worldwide.

&#x200B;

I'm working on a project to create an AI/AR filter that can take pre-recorded videos as input and automatically overlay 3D effects on things like hair, clothes, and backgrounds without replacing the person.

The goal is to train a neural network on videos that have been annotated with semantic segmentation masks for key areas. The network would then take new videos as input, segment the person, and output a 3D scene where just those segmented parts are converted into 3D meshes/textures that are composited back onto the original frame.

I've been researching approaches but could use some suggestions from the community on:

Best way to collect and annotate a training dataset

Effective neural network architectures for this task

Techniques for rendering and compositing the 3D overlays

Any other tips or recommendations for achieving this effect

Any advice or pointers would be greatly appreciated, as I'm new to working with video data and neural style transfer to 3D. Thanks in advance for your help!

Also I have a daz3d model that I want to trasnfer onto any human in the video but the rest such as the clothing hair and backround will have a 3d overlay.

AR_MR_XR,1708126343.0,,1asn3c6,t3_1asn3c6,0,1,"Abstract:

Creating digital avatars from textual prompts has long been a desirable yet challenging task. Despite the promising outcomes obtained through 2D diffusion priors in recent works, current methods face challenges in achieving high-quality and animated avatars effectively. In this paper, we present HeadStudio, a novel framework that utilizes 3D Gaussian splatting to generate realistic and animated avatars from text prompts. Our method drives 3D Gaussians semantically to create a flexible and achievable appearance through the intermediate FLAME representation. Specifically, we incorporate the FLAME into both 3D representation and score distillation: 1) FLAME-based 3D Gaussian splatting, driving 3D Gaussian points by rigging each point to a FLAME mesh. 2) FLAME-based score distillation sampling, utilizing FLAME-based fine-grained control signal to guide score distillation from the text prompt. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of HeadStudio in generating animatable avatars from textual prompts, exhibiting visually appealing appearances. The avatars are capable of rendering high-quality real-time (‚â•40 fps) novel views at a resolution of 1024. They can be smoothly controlled by real-world speech and video. We hope that HeadStudio can advance digital avatar creation and that the present method can widely be applied across various domains.

AR_MR_XR,1708061699.0,,1as11tn,t3_1as11tn,0,11,"This is the second benchmark test by OptoFidelity: 

Virtual content motion-to-photon latency is one of the most important factors when considering immersion. When we move, our brains expect to see a corresponding change in our visual perception. If those don‚Äôt match, we experience a phenomenon called sensory mismatch. The mismatch can be generated in multiple different ways and with multiple different senses and lead to discomfort and nausea.

In this test case, we concentrated on how well angular motion and displayed image motion match each other.

Details in the OptoFidelity blog: https://www.optofidelity.com/insights/blogs/apple-vision-pro-bencmark-test-2.-angular-motion-to-photon-latency-in-vr

Results: 

All the test subjects perform relatively well in terms of Motion-to-photon latency (MTP). HTC's 4ms response time is slightly higher than expected, but it's unlikely to be noticeable to the human eye. Meta has consistently performed very well in MTP Latency tests since the release of Quest 2. It comes as no surprise that Quest Pro and Quest 3 excel in this test, given Meta's extensive experience in fine-tuning their time-warp algorithms. Apple Vision Pro performs extremely well, too, with perhaps a little bit of aggressive prediction and/or time warp. However, differences of this magnitude cannot be sensed by the human eye.

What is Photon-to-Photon Latency:
 
A Head-mounted display's Photon-to-Photon latency describes the time it takes for the image to be transferred through the headset, to the user‚Äôs vision. When measuring the latency, we calculate the time difference between the lit of the light and the sense of that light on the location of the perceiver.  

The test confirmed Apple Vision Pro‚Äôs extremely low latency of ~11ms. The competitors' results are in the range of 35-40ms.

Bert Nepveu is a co-founder of VRvana, which made a enterprise mixed reality headset that was acquired by Apple in 2017 and provided a number of key innovations that have now shipped with the Apple Vision Pro. I had a chance to sit down with Nepveu to capture a comprehensive founder‚Äôs journey from the beginning inspiration in 2005, the first prototype in 2013, the failed Kickstarter in 2014 after the Crescent Bay prototype at Oculus Connect 1 stole their thunder, and then their pivot into more enterprise applications of AR via mixed reality passthrough that eventually led to their acquisition by Apple that started at GDC 2017 and closed in September 2017, and then was leaked to TechCrunch in November 2017.

Nepveu was also able to talk about his experiences of working at Apple, the challenges of point-of-view correction to minimize warping for mixed reality, and how the multiple stakeholders of human interaction, industrial design, and secrecy dictated by legal departments ended up battling it out over a number of different design decisions.

Nepveu left Apple around three years ago to become a general partner of a VC firm called TripTyq Capital that is funding content creation innovations, and he didn‚Äôt know if the Apple Vision Pro would ever actually ship or if he‚Äôd ever be able to talk about his many aspects of his journey with VRvana. But now that it has finally launched, he‚Äôs able to speak more about his journey and why it was so emotional for him to finally get a chance to do a demo of the consumer release of the Apple Vision Pro last week.

Apple is notoriously secretive about so many technical details of their product development and business in general, and so this is a very unique and rare peak behind the scenes on a portion of the timeline for how the Apple Vision Pro came about through the lens of which parts of the VRvana mixed reality headset were able to be shipped with the Apple Vision Pro.

Automatic-Isopod-614,1707928455.0,,1aqr4ha,t3_1aqr4ha,1,1,"I had an idea ever since the Oculus quest 2 released. A programm called Diamite. 
It is supposed to be an AR experience that you can use all over the world. And slowly the Idea faded because it seemed like no one cared about AR. Until the Apple Vision Pro.
The core principle of Diamite is that if AR gets developed enough you can walk around the city or house and see cool posters, 3D models and so much more. It works by using something like QR codes just much simpler. It would be a simple 32 digit binary number combination (that would make all possible combinations 4.294.967.296).
This code could be put up in let's say a caf√© and would hang on the wall. You as a proud AR user walk in and your goggles (in real-time) See the number combination and displays the menu and even maybe an interactive slider to see the coffees you might like. But wait? That wouldn't be real time would it? Because of the loading of the 3d model bla... bla... bla...
For this we use the DiamiteGPS system. As soon as you see a DiamiteCode your system will save the location and the next time you are there load the code before you enter the shop. This will be like streaming videos on netflix. You will not have to download anything it just sends the code to the server and the server sends the mesh info back and the goggles will load them.

Q.2) Why do I see work over internet on AR is mostly on IOS and not in android? Is it because Apple provides LIDAR?

rawrfrawrf,1707758723.0,,1ap5f2p,t3_1ap5f2p,2,1,"I'm an early-career data scientist, after recently finishing a graduate degree.  I have and will continue to spend a lot of time self-learning technical material from books and academic literature.  I'm wondering if anyone has used AR glasses for deep technical reading/studying.  I don't mean casually reading on a Kindle in bed - I mean like having big textbook open while working out homework problems.  

Many textbooks now are released for free in PDF, though I have occasionally opted to purchase paper versions.  Technical textbooks often need you to refer to plots, codeblocks, or equations so reading in a small window scrolling back and forth between pages can be a pain.  With a paper textbook, I can easily have it open on my desk (an approximately 20"" screen worth of information) without taking up one of my existing monitors.  When reading, I'll typically be taking handwritten notes using pen and paper.  

I'm wondering if any of you use AR glasses for technical learning/studying.  It would be great to have a large, two-page virtual view of a PDF textbook while still being able to take handwritten notes on a desk.  If so, what glasses would you recommend for this use case?

This is the first weekly stickied post where we will collect links to the news of the ongoing week. So click on the stickied post to get a quick overview! You can also use it to talk about what's going on in AR or the r/augmentedreality subreddit.

When I became admin of this subreddit, one of the suggestions was that there should not be 2 AR subreddits (the other one being the AR\_MR\_XR news feed). That's why the news posts will be integrated in this subreddit here from now on. And I will spend more time here moderating the posts.

Edit: In another blog they mentioned that this is for a 4k by 4k resolution OLED microdisplay.

~~I can't see any details about the resolution / PPI of the OLED version. I assume, that it's for a 3k to 4k pixel display. They only mention the stats for the older LCD version with lower resolution. But in the title they mention that it's for Apple competitors.~~

Machine translated announcement:

>Huynew Technology‚Äôs new pancake product Si-PK100 based on 1.35-inch OLED microdisplay will be launched in the near future. As an upgraded version of the Si-PK95 unveiled at SID 2023 in the United States last year, the Si-PK100 is optimized for a 3P architecture, lighter in weight (no more than 30g per eye , 1/3 lighter than the previous generation ), and FOV increased from 95 degrees to 100 degrees.  
>  
>Currently, the FOV of most modules on the market is between 95-100 degrees. It may exceed 100 degrees using curved sticker technology , but it is difficult to mass produce. Huynew‚Äôs new product Si-PK100 can achieve both light weight and large FOV, and can ensure mass production. .  
>  
>¬† In addition, the module‚Äôs exit pupil distance is 15mm@eyebox 10mm . Compared with similar products on the market with 11-13mm@eyebox 8mm , it can be adapted to more users who wear glasses, and it is easier for users to obtain a large field of view. Immersive experience, and the edges of the picture are clearer.

&#x200B;

[This module will be available for sample sales on February 18, 2024. Welcome to consult](https://preview.redd.it/e2sbfdxd9ghc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=70c906a609e4149eab663a3ee9f1a32ad9e036ce)

>Since Huynew Technology developed pancake optical technology in 2019 , the VR-PK (pancake) series optical modules can be equipped with 2.1inch, 2.48inch, 2.56inch LCD and 1.03inch , 1.3-1.4inch Si-OLED and many other models. The screen is used in many scenarios such as gaming, movie viewing, and drones. Among them, PK100 uses a 2.48/2.56-inch LCD screen and supports a single-eye resolution of 1920\*1800/2160\*2160 . While achieving a large field of view, this module is thinner than similar products already on the market. The module thickness is only 26mm.

&#x200B;

>**Introduction to Huynew Technology**  
>  
>Huynew Technology was founded in 2017 by three optical Ph.D.s. It is a national high-tech enterprise and a Shenzhen specialized new enterprise. It currently has a R&D team of 30 people, most of whom are from the optical / display industry background. The backbone comes from mobile phone cameras, projectors, and displays, screen and other industries. There are about 100 people in the self-owned production line . The company has currently submitted more than 130 patents , including more than 40 invention patents and 5 PCTs . Previously, Huynew has received multiple rounds of financing totaling nearly 100 million yuan.  
>  
>As the world's first AR-BB optical supplier, Huynew birdbath modules were mass-produced and shipped in Q3 of 2019 , with a total of more than 100,000 units shipped so far, ranking among the top AR peers at home and abroad. Its customers include the world's top 500 companies and the top 50 domestic VR companies. Huynew Technology will continue to focus on the research and development and mass production of AR/VR display modules, and continue to provide assistance to the industry and customers.

* [fulltrack-ai-youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKuOfdsKlkk)

In this applicaiton, the virtual cricket pitch is augmented on real pitch using Augmented Reality, (machineroad app has mentioned use of AR in app description, link: [machineroad-on-playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.machineroad.balltracking&hl=en&gl=US) ) and ball trajectory is tracked relative to the position of pitch.

I've also implemented a basic AR APP to augment virtual pitch, and user can scale, rotate and translate the pitch to adjust it according to real pitch. GitHub repo: [cricket-ar](https://github.com/MShahnoor/cricket-ar).

I've created this AR app using Unity and ARFoundation to place cricket pitch using a phone, but the challenge I'm facing is how to record an AR session so that it can be used for post processing, where I can edit the session to trace the trajectory of ball relative to virtual coordinates.

Simply putting, how to record video of AR session along with position and orientation of augmented objects, in a format that the session can be later retrived to edit the video to show the trajectory relative to pitch position.

P.S: I've tried using Record and Playback api of ARCore, it does saves the video and session data which is retrived in playback, but the playback is non-deterministic.

* CMS backend for direct upload/management of content
* Ability to share content direct from app to socials
* AR content triggered by QR or other marker at location
* AR content is a mix of informational and artistic and may feature audio, video, 2d and 3d images or animations, and textual content, either as standalone content, or as a composition in AR panels
* Quiz feature with decision trees, interacting either on in-app pop-ups or through AR content
* Prize functionality allowing for prizes to be won upon unlocking certain AR content
* User analytics
* App version on Android + iOS, not webAR due to remote locations within region, allowing for pre-use download
* Opt-in survey/data collection e.g. for major prize draw

Bonus points:

* Location-based push notifications (e.g. upon approaching a pin)
* White-labelling for rebranding

My life is essentially based on Windows stuff. Office365. Some coding, tech support, researching, reading browsing, YouTube etc. Not looking for a gaming solution.

I currently work off three laptops all pretty high spec, everything on cloud really or local apps installed and user data on Dropbox/SharePoint/Google drive. I have multiple jobs and projects and generally i exist 90% of the time at work in about 150 Google Chrome tabs. But i also gave edge for ms stuff, firefox for stuff and opera. All my laptops are 64GB machines and work just lovely. 

My work is that i either sit in front of a laptop all day, or i travel. When i travel, laptop use is just a pain. I'm bored of carrying one, sometimes two of them (i need redundancy) so I'm considering a Microsoft virtual desktop. 

I would like the real estate of a virtual display or an AR display connected to my phone or something truly portable. I am usually having to respond to a bunch of customer requests quite quickly and i need to jump onto my desktop and sort. That's half my life. To be able to put on a pair of glasses, be connected to my desktop pretty quickly and be up and running where i left my desktop state in 10 seconds would greatly enhance my life.

Maybe an AR product is not my solution not really sure. I want a nice big screen and be able to manage a bunch of windows desktops. I would rather not use my laptops when traveling. Maybe that's a showstopper.

At the moment I have been just working on mine as a document. However the research for the project frequently focuses on the use of augmented reality, among other digital tools, within the field of architecture. 

I was struck by the idea of somehow adding an AR element to my dissertation for the exhibition and I think this would be received well when grading. I‚Äôm talking a simple concept of being able to view a 3D or sculptural effect when viewing my printed paper document through the smartphone. 
The project is an analysis of themes like ‚Äúhyperreality‚Äù, so having a surreal hazy affect that appears when scanned would be super cool.

I‚Äôve done some research but have been a little overwhelmed with working out what this would involve ! It is not something I have worked with before. I am however relatively fluent in various 3D modelling software, if this is something that would possibly be required to achieve this.

If anyone has any suggestions for whether my idea is achievable, or any applications worth looking into, I would massively appreciate it. Thanks",Advice?

OlivencaENossa,1704371505.0,,18yc2wd,t3_18yc2wd,1,1," Hi everyone,

Recently started working with some files from the iOS app Record3D. It records RGBD video and can export PLY files.

A friend of mine wants to **convert point clouds (PLY) coming in from this app into something usable in ARKit as an animated point cloud.** He can‚Äôt use Unity atm as he is targeting a very specific feature of ARKit audio.

I am working with the files mostly in Houdini. This worked great as Houdini has native PLY support and it correctly saw the sequence of files as an animated point cloud. 

After doing some work on this PLY, we exported USD to Reality Converter only to get one of two errors:

1. **No animation in the USD. Blender and Houdini read the file as Animation, but the Apple Reality Converter does NOT see ANY animation.** We get a single unmoving mesh. So, the same file will show animation in Blender and Houdini, but NOT in Reality Converter.
2. Another error we sometimes get is ***‚ÄúInvalid node type in USD file. UsdGeomPointInstancers and custom schemas not provided by core USD are not allowed.‚Äù***

**I am completely at a loss on why Apple Reality Converter does not see the animation when other apps do.** I have exported simple test cube animations from Blender, Maya and Houdini and they all work, but the animation we get from the point clouds does not work.

I am also at a loss on how UsdGeomPointInstancers can be avoided. I‚Äôve read the USD spec here: [Universal Scene Description: UsdGeomPointInstancer Class Reference (openusd.org)](https://openusd.org/dev/api/class_usd_geom_point_instancer.html#details) 

So two questions:

* Why is it that some apps will read USD Animation coming from a point cloud and Reality Converter won‚Äôt?
* How can I remove the UsdGeomPointInstancers from the file? 

A sample of the PLY files, alongside other files is here: [https://we.tl/t-CPucph0sgI](https://we.tl/t-CPucph0sgI)

Attached is an Alembic file I‚Äôve extracted from Houdini, and a USD file that fails Reality Converter but works in Blender, and my HIP file. I am using Houdini Indie so I‚Äôm not sure if anyone can open this.

**I wonder whether there‚Äôs a better way of doing it that could avoid some of these issues.**

I have found this in this subreddit -  [https://spase.io/converter](https://spase.io/converter) \- it used to be recommended as a converter, but it seems to no longer have that function.

I have a lot of experience with mixed reality devices and have owned multiple see through AR headsets over the years (a HoloLens 1, Magic Leap 1 & Magic leap 2, an Nreal light etc) and have just gotten my first taste of video passthrough MR with quest 3. It looks sooo much better when using passthrough mode if you take the light seal off. The virtual objects you put in your environment feel much more present and the experience overall just feels significantly more real once you have access to your peripheral vision and aren't just looking through a portal into the real world.

Almost everyone who has used both the quest 3 and quest pro seems to agree with me and prefers the open design of the quest pro for AR applications. With quest 3, you have to buy a new headstrap to use it without the light seal or else it won't sit on your face properly, or you can just take the light seal off and hold the headset up to your face which is what I did, but that obviously isn't ideal for any kind of long term use.

It's worth mentioning that I do definitely prefer a light seal for VR, but it just seems strange to me that a headset like Vision Pro that is almost entirely focused on AR applications would be designed so that you have no access to your peripheral vision and are effectively looking through a hole at the real world. Either way I'm still super excited to get my hands on it when it releases, but I'm really, really hoping someone will release a third party headstrap so I can use it without the light seal.",Do you think there will be 3rd party head straps that let you use the Vision Pro without the light seal?,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/augmentedreality/comments/18wac9k/do_you_think_there_will_be_3rd_party_head_straps/

We are building a separate version build of an AR application, which is to be used as an MR experience.

When I build a mixed reality app (camera passthrough) view for the Meta Quest 3, the model does spawn properly, but there are latency issues. The experience is not as smooth, making it a bad 'first impression' for someone trying MR for the first time. The 3D models are jittery and the overall fidelity of the experience is not great.

Been thinking a ton about the future of entertainment and film and how AI and AR is going to impact it. Specifically the concept of social and immersive movies where viewers are the main characters.

**Personalized Storytelling:**

* **Customizable Narratives:** Imagine movies with branching storylines. Your choices shape the plot, leading to unique endings each time you watch. You are the main character.
* **AI-Driven Plot Adaptation:** The story evolves in real-time based on your reactions and choices, thanks to advanced AI. Sort of like an LLM but instead of predicting the next word based on context, it has a great understanding of what the ""next scene"" would look like based on you actions.

**Immersive Technology:**

* **VR Integration:** Step into a 360-degree movie environment, interacting with characters and settings as if you're part of the film.
* **AR Experiences:** Cinematic elements blend into your real world, making the fiction part of your reality.
* **Haptic Feedback:** Feel the movie through tactile feedback, scents, and even temperature changes.

**Social Interaction:**

* **Multiplayer Story Experiences:** Watch movies with friends as supporting characters, influencing the story together.
* **Community-Driven Storylines:** Online communities could vote on plot developments.

I think the next gen could very interesting. It could blur the lines between movies, games, and social experiences, creating a form of entertainment that's both deeply personal and communal. Would love to hear some thoughts!

Accurate-Screen8774,1700729088.0,,181wuhg,t3_181wuhg,5,2,"Hey everyone,

We're thrilled to introduce a groundbreaking feature in our app - Decentralized P2P video calls in virtual reality on a browser. Check out the online AR demo [here](https://chat-staging.positive-intentions.com/verse).

**Development of the 3D Environment:**

* **BabylonJS Exploration:** We're diving into BabylonJS to create a 3D space that, although less stable now, holds great promise.
* **Work in Progress:** This feature is an unstable proof-of-concept and still in active development, but we're excited about its potential as an extension to the chat functionality.
* **Live and Testable:** While not finalized, certain parts are live and ready for testing. AR is temporarily disabled for peer calls due to performance issues (to be fixed when we are able), but you can use on-screen joystick controls or WASD controls for navigation.  To test, you can start by creating a video call to a peer (the link above is for a solo-AR experience.).
* **Refresh for Stability:** (Sorry) Occasionally, you might need to refresh your browser page if you encounter any instabilities.
* **Optimal AR Experience:** We envision the best AR experience on a mobile phone, in a flat, open space outdoors where you can move around. Plans are underway to expand the 3D space.
* **Environment Elements:** the environment is basic as we get started. There is a ""mirror cube"" capturing input from your phone camera, floating rotating cubes for aesthetics, and have plans for more 3D models and interaction capabilities.
* **Group Video Calls in AR:** Exciting plans to support group video calls in AR, bringing a new dimension to shared experiences.

**FAQ?**

* **Why does this app exist:** Our journey is an exploration of what's possible in a decentralized architecture, pushing the boundaries of technology.
* **3D and AR in Mainstream:** With 3D and AR gaining popularity, we believe browsers can offer robust support for these capabilities.
* **Open Source:** the app is a work in progress in early development and not suitable for open sourcing. Code related to the apps cryptographics and security functionalities can be seen in [this unmaintained snippet](https://github.com/positive-intentions/.github/blob/main/cryptography/Cryptography.js).
* We welcome curiosity and questions so feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the app.

* So in my head, the app would have a Firebase DB to store anchors and 3D models.
* It must be relatively easy for a city employee to upload the 3D model to Firebase.
* How we get 3D models are out of the scope of the project.
* Display models at their respective anchors on citizen phones.
* Handling of comments for each displayed 3D models

the augmented-reality environment is basic, but working. there is a webcam stream into the AR environment (that will be replaced with a video stream from a peer when the functionality). the video component will move around based on the peers position in the AR space.

**id like to hear what you think about this new addition to the p2p architecture** (or any other aspect of it). this new funtionality will compliment the existing functionalities of the decentralization app:

* chat
* video/audio calls
* file sharing
* screen sharing
* social media

(note: the app is not a product or monetized in any way. it is a proof-of-concept to determine how/what is possible in a browser-based p2p architecture. some source code for transparency on [security+encryption](https://github.com/positive-intentions/.github/blob/main/cryptography/Cryptography.js) here)

ü•ΩAs Extended Reality (XR), the umbrella term encompassing Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), continues to proliferate, it's reshaping how we interact with and perceive our surroundings. But with this technological evolution, I've identified a need for a new term to describe reality-filtering technologies that alter our individual perceptions.

üîÆWhy is this important? Consider this: as we increasingly live in our own tailored worlds, filtering out unwanted elements, what implications does this hold for our societal fabric? Conflicts are on the rise, and the loneliness epidemic is metastasizing. Does closing ourselves off in these personalized bubbles exacerbate our isolation? Imagine, for instance, selectively hearing only the serene chirping of a Blue Jay, while inadvertently filtering out critical sounds of someone calling for help behind you.
ü´ßThis isn't just about personal preference; it's an extension of the 'filter bubble' phenomenon, where our exposure to diverse perspectives and experiences diminishes.

I'd be super interested in hearing about any AAR experiences people may have encountered or tested (or heard of). Mobile apps, art pieces, museum exhibitions... Anything based on audio only without visuals, using location and/or head tracking, some degree of spatialised (3D) sound, and having a strong relationship with the environment. Indoors or outdoors.  


The medium is still quite niche, and I've personally encountered only a few exhibitions or sound installations that could be described as AAR. I'm aware of just a handful more, and of course university research projects, but there must be many more out there for public. Which are not necessary called ""AAR"", however. Then there are, of course, many geolocative mobile apps for outdoors, Zombies, Run! being the classic example. Some of them even support head-tracking should someone have compatible headphones.  


Since I've noticed the headphone manufacturers like to advertise their newest products with the hot tag ""Audio Augmented Reality"", I'd like to know what kind of apps there actually are and if people have really used them.

Hello everyone.))))

Today, I want to talk about optimization and look development. I want to show you my technology and my old prototypes **from 2019 to 2021**, which can achieve post-production level on mobile devices, on any engine. Watch the video, I hope you'll like it.

I'm a creator from Ukraine, and I enjoy participating in exciting projects. I'm deeply involved in CG in all its aspects(over 16 years), serving as a 3D generalist with a wide range of expertise in 3D, VFX, AR, and game development. Recently, I've been focusing on AR alongside my team, and we go by the name ARRR. We create augmented reality experiences of various levels and are constantly on the lookout for new opportunities.

I've also had an extensive tenure at Snap Inc., You might remember some of my hits, such as the furry animal ears(like a bunny), during the early days of Snapchat. I did many those and i have awards

&#x200B;

Conclusion: This technology was originally developed for creating hair in AR, but it became evident during the process that it has broader usage.

Hello, ue5 peeps 

I'm currently engrossed in a Halloween project and I could really use some technical expertise! üéÉ

Here's the scoop: I've built part of a  3D asylum with Unreal Engine to map onto a site . The site is a historical gem, originally established way back in 1878. Interestingly, my neighborhood sits on the old asylum grounds. üèöÔ∏è

Now, here's where I need your knowledge. I've selected a portion of this asylum to integrate into an existing location using AR. Imagine a commemorative space with the asylum's last standing wall and window ‚Äì I've attached an image for reference.

I've opted to work with Aero due to its user-friendly and cost-effective nature, and we're fortunate to have early access to the geospatial features. However, I've hit a technical roadblock: optimization. The Unreal file for my ""set"" isn't excessively large, but I have ambitious plans to incorporate a couple of 3D animated ghosts. As you might have guessed, things tend to get resource-heavy quite swiftly, much like this lengthy post! üòÖ

So, here's the twist. I'm contemplating using a cube map for the set because a.png will be much lighter than a glb file , but it's been challenging to ensure it stays precisely aligned with the site, especially after nightfall. üåô
Im not sure if a cube map will even work for AR. Can you walk around in it ?

I was going to test all this out but now I‚Äôm running out of time. ‚åõÔ∏è

I'm a beginner in the Unity and AR world. I have Unity with AR Foundation installed and playing with an Android device for now.  I'm trying to figure out what to use in order to make the following functionality:

I want to have a mobile app which would detect when a physical book is opened and place some AR content on top of its pages. 

I've successfully made a first demo where I can do this using image detection and image replacement. However this is not a working approach for what I'm aiming for. I'd like to detect a book's page not by having an exact image copy of the page itself and recognize it but in a more intelligent computer vision approach. 

&#x200B;

I'd like to be able to put AR content on many books, so I'd like to have as an input for the app:

1) You are currently looking at an opened book (how to do this basic recognition?)

2) Which book is opened (this would be known in advance)

3) Which page am I looking at (this would be a later challenge - recognize page number with computer vision)

&#x200B;

As far as I see one approach is to use OpenCV but I don't see a good support for Mobile devices in Unity.

I'm just re-researching AR platforms and am wondering why WorldCAST seem to be so cheap for dev compared to the rest of the WebAR I can find. Is there major limitations in the free version? I'm a personal developer and do AR for ART projects and small events that have a tiny budget (last AR app I made I had a 1,200euro budget to create 3 3d experiences and an app for google play).

I've developed a few apps using Unity for AR but the limited Android availablility of ARCore and of course the hassle of working in Apple Store means for smaller quick turnaround, art based or event based projects it's just unworkable.

I'm new to the whole WebAR thing. Can someone explain the difference between using something like WorldCAST and creating a unity app? Is it just that it needs a QRcode to access the marker image as opposed to downloading the app? Where does the 3d model, sounds etc sit? Is it on the Worldcast Servers or can you host them yourself? And lastly how good is the renderer?

I used to use Augment for a while for marker based stuff but they stopped allowing Marker Based 3d. I also used Metaio back at the start of AR- loved it especially for the animation side of things as I used to work in games so the MD2 model format was a familiar thing to me. They stopped developing that very suddenly but it was a nice platform and well ahead of it's time.

The whole idea of the experience is that the mural itself will contain the history of an area, and when scanned, there will be several image trackers, and when scanned they will offer up information about that building, i.e. This brewery was created in 1870, etc, and possibly a link to a wikipedia page, company website, etc.

First off at the moment I'm developing in SparkAR, partly because it's free, and secondly because I know it allows for multiple image trackers and lastly because its can link with people's socials, etc.

So my first question is, is this the best software to be developing this kind of AR experience, or is there something cost effective out there that would be better suited to this functionality?

Secondly, I've come across a stumbling block in SparkAR itself. Essentially I need each prompt that appears when an image tracker is discovered, to be animated in, rather than just appear. Firstly, I can't even figure out if that's an option, and if it is any tutorials you could direct me to would be a huge help?

Lastly, my brain's kind of figured out that I should be able to do this with animation sequences. I.e. when the image tracker is discovered, the intro animation is played, then an animation loop is played? I've already created both the intro animations and loop animations in after effects, but I can't figure out how to get them to play sequentially?

*I  think we're blindly wandering into a future where the whole Internet,  and all screen-related activity with it, all computing, is going to  disappear behind a paywall, into an app store, and out of our control.*

*In this post and others at* [*Augmented Realist*](https://noahnorman.substack.com/)*, I'm advocating for an augmented reality internet that reflects our values.*

There was a period of time during which one could be tricked into thinking there was a mainstream consensus on reality. That time seems to be coming to an end, with some mixed consequences.

That consensus, though, consisted of a very small subset of the realm of possible ideas, and even during periods of widespread accord, we each, personally, carry subjective perspectives and opinions that may be rare, or even unique to us.

If you ask a hundred people to describe a given person, dog, building, tree, product, vehicle, artwork, shoe, a frog, etc., you will, for each item, get back a distribution of language - a word cloud - with lots of overlap, and likely some outliers as well. Some of those outliers you might reject as objectively wrong, but some might be a matter of opinion.

To give an example, take the frog. Someone unfamiliar with frogs but generally afraid of them might describe that frog as 'huge' and 'slimy', whereas a herpetologist might describe the frog as 'small', and furthermore 'variegated', or 'aposomatic', 'toxic', 'sexually dimorphic', etc. It's entirely possible, especially in the case of things as varied and under-classified as frogs, that another herpetologist might disagree with one or more of the suggestions of the first.

Similarly one could imagine the exercise leading to some honest disagreement about, for example, the descriptors of land or territory, or about a person. Think about the words that might be used to describe the West Bank, or a controversial politician, and then compare that collection of descriptors to the language used on their Wikipedia pages.

I'm not trying to argue that knowledge-organizing projects like Wikipedia, Wikidata, the Semantic Web, corporate knowledge graphs, good old-fashioned maps, etc. represent wasted effort, but rather that they necessarily encode a viewpoint, in most cases that of a compromise based on some moderation rules, on the nature of a thing, or, taken in the gestalt, on the nature of reality.

By their design, these efforts minimize contradiction and compartmentalize disagreements, creating an institutional perspective that, at a certain scale, takes on the likeness of fact, and confers that status to subjective statements contained therein. And even though projects like Wikipedia are available in a rainbow of languages, language itself encodes cultural perspectives.

When we begin connecting the digital world to the physical world, if we do so with a process where authorities, corporations, or institutions, however well-meaning, are exclusively responsible for naming and labeling the world, we run the risk of hegemonizing semiosis. As evidence of how untenable a single universal viewpoint is, Google has long ago given up on serving one map to the whole world and now shows different borders depending on who's asking.

This is not a matter of degree - something you can do better or worse - you can either make this mistake or avoid it entirely. On the internet today, anyone can provide a service that is topically about an idea, person, place, or thing, and those services, in form of apps, web pages, and protocols, anyone can find and reach via search, shared links, direct navigation, and so on.

I've already made the case that [we shouldn't trust anyone](https://noahnorman.substack.com/p/augments-are-speech) with the ability to dictate what digital things can and can't be connected to the real world. Nor should we even contemplate a system wherein artificial limitations on how many digital things can occupy the same connection, or space. Those approaches create a new kind of property and [bring landlords along](https://noahnorman.substack.com/p/animism) into what is otherwise an unbounded new resource.

The most natural framework for mapping arbitrary data (ideas) onto the world's things and concepts is the one we already have - language, but rather than offer a top-down description of the world onto which we connect our digital information, whether crowdsourced or centrally-controlled, we should allow the descriptions themselves to be as open as the digital world they enable.

**In helping machines interpret the world around them, users should be in control of whose language they employ to describe the world, and when.**

Longer story - the drafter is my mom, so there's that.  She's 70, a lifelong artist focused on 2d oil paintings, and pretty darn good at it.  She's seen examples of AR used in artwork and wants to replicate the effect - trees rustling, animals coming to life, flowers reaching out & sniffing the audience, that kind of stuff.

I'm guessing the 2d/3d animation is a whole additional layer to the piece, but where would I start digging in on the AR side?

My wife and I  have been bitten by the AR bug. We have a background in design for film.  We are  looking to dive into AR storytelling. Our goal is to create an AR scavenger hunt for kids aged 5-7 (with parents' help) in a local park, approximately half the size of a football field. We're not coders, but we're considering Adobe Aero for its user-friendliness and we  have adobe know how.

Here's what we're aiming for:

1. **Platform:** We want our AR scavenger hunt to be available on both Apple and Android devices.
2. **Location-Based:** Ideally, we'd like to use geolocation, but we're open to QR codes if it simplifies things.
3. **Navigation:** We need a way to guide participants with arrows or a map within the AR experience.
4. **Graphics:** To keep file sizes small, we're planning to use layered 2D images.
5. **Future Plans:** Our long-term goal is to expand to larger-scale scavenger hunts and make the files more complex 3D. 

Any advice on the software/tools to achieve this project? I work in unreal, but I have seen that its not great for Android. Unity and C# seems like a chalenging programming  language. I can do a little python(with chat gpt help)  Also our 3D design programmes work well with Unreal. I use Rhino, Grasshopper and keyshot with a little blender.   
 We'd also like to know if Nvidia Omniverse is a viable option, Geenie AR looks great too.   
I have been working in stable diffusion and do know my way around git hub.  I have been reading up on software but as it is a rapidly growing technology I thought asking here might be helpful.

The process might require technology to activate, perhaps using electrodes to stimulate the visual cortex through the occipital lobe, and the brain learns to produce it's own desired hallucinations, with the help of a visual training VR headset.

 I'm just re-researching AR platforms and am wondering why WorldCAST seem to be so cheap for dev  compared to the rest of the WebAR I can find. Is there major limitations in the free version? I'm a personal developer and do AR for ART projects and small events that have a tiny budget (last AR app I made I had a 1,200euro budget to create 3 3d experiences and an app for google play).

I've developed a few apps using Unity for AR but the limited Android availablility of ARCore and of course the hassle of working in Apple Store means for smaller quick turnaround, art based or event based projects it's just unworkable.

I'm new to the whole WebAR thing. Can someone explain the difference between using something like WorldCAST and creating a unity app? Is it just that it needs a QRcode to access the marker image as opposed to downloading the app? Where does the 3d model, sounds etc sit? Is it on the Worldcast Servers or can you host them yourself? And lastly how good is the renderer? 

I used to use Augment for a while for marker based stuff but they stopped allowing Marker Based 3d. I also used Metaio back at the start of AR- loved it especially for the animation side of things as I used to work in games so the MD2 model format was a familiar thing to me. They stopped developing that very suddenly but it was a nice platform and well ahead of it's time.

Anyway any help appreciated!

* Vuforia AR for Image Target
* Google drive for cloud storage off audio from where it downloads.

If it is possible - can it also trigger sound from their device?

To start off, I do inline skating as a hobby and the type of skating I do is freestyle slalom where we skate through equally size space cones to practice and perform tricks. 

However, the pain point of it comes from measuring the lane and placing cones, typically whenever we skate at a new area we need physical tapes and mark them with equally sized intervals of 80cm x 20. which requires a length of 16m for a typical lane which is usually a tedious process. 

Looking that there are measuring apps like AR ruler in the market that helps to measure a  point in cm from A to B. 

I came up with an AR app idea that extends the AR ruler app that lets you mark measurements in intervals and lets you place and track cones' alignment based on the line the AR has measured. 

The idea of it is that when you are at a location you scan around the environment using the app and press the generate button to generate a line with interval markings of 80 cm which indicates to the user where to place the cone with AR. This line then tracks the placement of cones in whether the user correctly places the cones on the designated marking. 

Being new to AR with a background in web development in my day job I have the following questions.   


1) How feasible is the app idea with the current AR tools in the market? 

2) What are some resources and tools I can look into if I want to build this app myself (8th wall vs unity) 

3) How accurate are measurements done with existing AR apps? 

4) Any other feedback and advice? 

  
Really appreciate anyone's input and advice on this :)

‚Ä¢¬†The  world‚Äôs largest companies are racing to create vertically-integrated  augmented reality systems. Those systems, because of their form factor,  will eat all computing.

‚Ä¢ The rules of their ecosystems will  determine what is possible for almost every user in almost every digital  activity. If that sounds like the situation for apps on iOS, remember no matter how locked down iPhones are today, they still can access the  web, which is a mostly free environment.

‚Ä¢ The way things are  going, there will be no analogue to the wide-open web for augmented reality. The only AR-native activities users will be able to undertake, and developers will be able to create, will be those sanctioned by, and taxed by, the Metas and Googles and Apples.

‚Ä¢ All computing activity must be co-signed by the platform creators. Concerns over digital rights aren‚Äôt nice-to-haves or policy-wonk wish list items anymore. We do everything online, and the often-horrific examples of what happens when you don‚Äôt have privacy and self-determination on the internet are piling up.

‚Ä¢ When your computer (AR glasses or contacts or implants) is in between you and the world, then everything you do is on your computer, and today‚Äôs problems are magnified a  thousandfold.

‚Ä¢ When, not if, augmented reality eats all computing, it won‚Äôt make the web we have today go away. Flat ‚Äòscreens‚Äô still work in AR, and flat-screen experiences are even more ergonomic and convenient when you can put the screen anywhere, at any size. But,  despite some heroic efforts to make it so for a very long time by some very smart people, the web we have today is not going to provide the  backbone for a real AR-first internet.

‚Ä¢ While it‚Äôs natural to first conceive of single-purpose augmented reality applications - things like HUDs, games, and tools - the more profound thing I‚Äôm trying to unlock is the ability for anyone to attach any digital thing to any real thing, person, or place much as we already do with concepts, ideas, and language. That ‚Äòaugment space‚Äô, or ‚ÄòA Space‚Äô, idea is where the real power of AR lives.

‚Ä¢ I propose we create a means for anyone to attach any digital thing to any real thing, and for users to access those digital things in a way that reflects our values, and in this post  I begin the discussion about how to make it happen.

For the  first time, comments are on for this one - please let me know your reactions and what I'm missing, big- or small-picture.

I am currently deciding on my topic for my bachelor thesis in computer science (but i have roughly 12-15 years of experience as a software engineer, although spent the last 3-4 in the biotech scene, its a long story) and i decided to do it at the company im currently employed as an SE on the side. The problem is, i was super busy the last 2 months with work to finance some upcoming medical treatments, I didnt have much time to give it thought. I was presented several options by my employer, although most of them don't sound all too exciting. 

However, last week I was presented an opportunity for a project given to us by a big client company surrounding the development of an AR app. The details are very rough and barely present, but im running out of time and need to decide this week. Its mostly about visualizing certain things in the real world so people can get an understanding of it in terms of scale and how it would look/feel, for example on construction sites or marketing locations. AR sounds fun as a concept, but i passed by it a bit in 2017 and to be honest it was kind of a mess. Now, that was 6 years ago, so a lot must have happened since then. Although the opportunity as a whole seems lucrative, also due to the connections i would build, i'm kind of not sure if the idea of it sounds more interesting than it will be to work with it.

Can someone give me some rough insight into how far AR development has come? Whats your experiences with modern day AR app development frameworks, what in regards to which thinks are possible today quite easily also in terms of hardware performance on smartphones? What in terms of cross-platform?

Any input is welcomed. 

I have no problem working very hard and long to obtain new skills, but my main worry is that its just a huge chore and still kind of a mess, without feeling really rewarding and likely not yielding any desired results.

&#x200B;

Currently I am using ARFoundation with ARKit and the ARKit Scanner to setup and detect real world objects with unity.

However I am not super happy with the detection of my objects. It is very dependent on the lighting and in general in my case it is not super stable.

I used Vuforia in the past, which I think is more stable with the object detection, but decided to switch because of the pricing.

I am thinking of going back now again.

Do you have any experience with alternatives for object detection? (Do you know Visionlib or other software?)

I would be also interested in pricing of the tools. It is realy difficult to find prices on their websites.

Thx and Cheers

A new Apple patent describes technology for its rumored Apple Vision Pro headset. It could visualize non-visible phenomena like Wi-Fi signals, airflow, and temperature.

The headset would use sensors to detect signals like electromagnetic fields. It would then overlay visual representations in the wearer's view.

This could help engineers troubleshoot by seeing hidden infrastructure like HVAC systems. The patent covers use in a headset and a future Apple Car windshield.

The capability shows the potential for Apple's headset to blend digital information with real-world views.

1. Build AR softwares that can actually be used by people, be it an app or integrated into any pre-existing hardware

2. Get to a professional level to actually utilise that skill well enough to get a paid job

Hey!

I'm currently working on a project where I need to modify STL or GLB files to give an object different colors based on its height. I want to achieve something like this: 

[from this](https://preview.redd.it/th16pzgh27eb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c63737d88784635bba1e087eeafe3a037270ff19)

I'm wondering if anyone here has experience with editing STL or GLB files using HTML or Python. I want to explore the possibility of automating this process to apply colors at different heights programmatically.

Here are my specific questions:

Is it feasible to edit STL or GLB (doesn‚Äôt matter which file type) files programmatically using HTML or Python (doesn‚Äôt matter what language)?

Are there any libraries or tools you recommend for this task?

If you've done something similar before, could you share some example code or point me in the right direction?
