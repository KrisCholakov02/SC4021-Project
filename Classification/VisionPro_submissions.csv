The dual loop band is comfortable, but this really allows your blood to flow around your head and is so much softer. Since the attachment point is further up, it lifts the headset away from your face a bit more. For the second iteration, I will be 3-D printing a part to make it look a lot better. Also SO much easier to adjust. I‚Äôm surprised Apple did not come up with this in the first place. Downside, is you have to buy an extra band which is $100. In my opinion, though, totally worth it.

zjkingsley,1707150343.0,,1ajki9t,t3_1ajki9t,587,886,"I received my Vision Pro Friday morning, and have spent roughly 12-15 hours inside already. I have a couple thoughts I'd like to share, if anybody is interested.

This is without a doubt, the most incredible piece of consumer technology ever shipped. Unfortunately, I believe there was a breakdown internally at Apple between the R&D department and the marketing department in releasing this product.

Apple has focused on a variety of ""gimmicky"" features in marketing and demo'ing the AVP; dinosaurs, spatial video, EyeSight, FaceTime w/ personas, etc. This was a bit of an ""own goal"" on Apple's part, that has lead to a smattering of hit piece reviews, particularly Nilay Patels. His review, WILL NOT AGE WELL. I promise you all that.

These reviews are focusing on the gimmicky features Apple pushed towards the public to pique their interest. And due to this mis-marketing, muckraker reporters like Nilay Patel have called out Apple's mistake by focusing their reviews on the gimmicks, rather than the strength of the platform, which is truly groundbreaking. For instance, personas are irrelevant to this system. It's fun, it solves a small FaceTime issue. It should not have been a material part of Nilay's review, and instead he (and many others) decry Apple for putting out a weird uncanny valley beta avatar. This is akin to reviewing the first iterations of the Ford Model T, and saying ""I really can't believe you have to get out of the car and start it with a hand crank"". Then stating people shouldn't buy the car, and should stick with the horse and buggy, because it's not a convenient apparatus to start.

People are failing to understand that this is not a VR/AR headset that does X, Y, and Z. Apple developed a spatial computing platform (as properly marketed by Apple), which allows you to do whatever you'd like to do, and whatever developers can dream up. The Vision Pro, is simply the apparatus to see it through. The base of the spatial computing system and Vision OS 1.0 is truly remarkable and something I never thought I would see in my lifetime. Is it slightly buggy... actually NO! It's fairly rock solid, more so than I thought, and much more than appears in the vid captures from the device in reviews. These screencaptures do not do the OS justice, as it shows the ""foveated rendering"" which you cannot see with your eyes while using the device.

For instance last night, I was lying in bed, in a VR environment, looking at the stars, in crystal clear clarity, with a small window open talking to a friend via Messages, and just beyond that, mounted in the sky, was a 100 foot wide screen which had The Social Network running in simply the clearest quality I have ever seen outside of 15/70 IMAX.

This is a hard concept to market because it's so flexible. It relies on the creativity of the user in order to truly shine, just like a laptop. Some people will do amazing things with Mac OS, and some people will just answer emails and watch YouTube. This is a computing PLATFORM, not a DEVICE or a TOY.

In so many of these reviews, they simply pull up a safari window and watch YouTube and say ""that's cool, but really what else can we do?"" Then they show the poor personas and say, well Apple really missed the mark here. It's hard to describe just how much a window is like a piece of glass in Vision OS, that is SO ANCHORED DOWN in 3D space. It's up to the user to decide how to use this in a fun and productive way, and 99% of tech reviews, aren't that creative! I won‚Äôt even discuss the eye tracking technology, because it just works. It‚Äôs indescribably accurate. 

One more tidbit; from the design of the hardware, it is clear to me that the Apple Design team was aiming for a ""space travel"" / ‚Äúmoonshot‚Äù theme. The Vision Pro case is a dyneema-like covered padded box, similar to the boxes NASA uses with padding and white ripstop material on their space missions and in their spacesuits. The Vision Pro itself has a very ""Stormtrooper"" look. Even the orange release tabs for the headbands all scream ""space travel"", ""state of the art aviation"", and ""government special projects"" to me. I believe this is all because the intent of the product from the Design Dept. is to prepare you for traveling to another world, like the exploration of space, the final frontier. This is more akin to a Virgin Galatic flight than iPad. This is the final frontier of computing, and we will never return to physical screens again in a real way again.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

PS, this article is to illustrate how Apple's mis-marketing of the device lead to milquetoast reviews and a lot of public backlash / hate. It is my belief that these reviewers judged the product against Apple's marketing expectations (which is their right) vs. what was shipped in the box.

&#x200B;

I'm happy to answer any questions anyone might dream up.

What happened - last night I polished the front of the headset, packed it away with the cover on, and when I woke up this morning, i see this crack. No drop, no shuffling in the case. 

There seems to be a consistent manufacturing issue with the glass - my ignorant guess is the unique form creates some tension above the nose that eventually cracks, even without any outside force. 

I have apple care and expect a free replacement when I head in to the genius bar, but for those of you who understandably didn‚Äôt spring for the 500$ coverage, this would suck. I hope it‚Äôs more rare than i‚Äôm making it out to be, but if not, apple better cover this under factory warranty and not consider it accidental damage that would require a hefty repair fee.

imatowell,1706940000.0,,1ahp6yx,t3_1ahp6yx,355,432,"I‚Äôve been excited for this for weeks and couldn‚Äôt wait to pick my order today. Now, after using for about 8 hours, I‚Äôm 90% sure I‚Äôm going to return it and I‚Äôm actually pretty crushed about it. I have never used a VR headset before, so probably went into this with too high expectations. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs significantly better than the competition, but I guess I was expecting more based on some of the reviews/reactions I read.

1. Pass through is no where near as good as Apple and some reviews made it out to be. Every time i move everything gets extremely blurry. If you‚Äôre not in a perfectly lit room everything seems a bit grainy. It‚Äôs extremely obvious you‚Äôre looking through a display.

2. Text/UI elements don‚Äôt look  as sharp as my iPad  Pro. It‚Äôs good, but noticeably worse than what I‚Äôm used to. This is especially true while reading text towards the edge of your field of view. You kind of have to physically turn your head to follow along as you read text.  If you just are moving your eyes, the further you get from the center of the field of view the blurrier the text gets.

3. Everything seems dimmer than I expected, including the UI, pass through, and HDR movies. It also seems a little washed out- kind of how it looks when you put a matte screen protector on an iPhone/iPad.

4. I‚Äôm seeing what seem to be a lot of reflections within the lenses when watching movies, or looking at any window with high contrast, and it‚Äôs distracting. Not sure if this is because I have prescription lenses in there.

5. Eye tracking is impressive at first, but starts getting frustrating very quickly. Too often it just doesn‚Äôt do what I want.

6. It‚Äôs really not comfortable for me unless I‚Äôm lying down or resting my head back. It‚Äôs heavier than I was hoping, and digs into the bridge of my nose a bit. I tried multiple light seals at the Apple Store, and the ones that were most comfortable (bigger ones) had too much light leakage, and the ones with little to no light leakage were more uncomfortable. I ended up with what I thought was the best middle ground, but it‚Äôs not great.

7. The FOV was smaller than expected.

8. Everything just seems harder/slower to navigate than expected. Even doing something as simple as moving the text curser when it‚Äôs in the wrong spot caused me endless frustration. Maybe this is just something I‚Äôd get better at the more I use, but in the meantime it‚Äôs been frustrating..

In general, AVP seems more finicky/uncomfortable/grainy/dimmer/and generally less impressive than I was hoping. Placing as many windows as you want wherever you want, and making them as big as you want was really really cool, but all the the issues I listed above just degraded the experience to the point where I don‚Äôt think I could justify keeping this for the price.  It felt like a relief to go back to the real world and my bright/crisp/easier to use/manipulate 12.9 inch iPad Pro.

I‚Äôm glad I tried it and I‚Äôm excited for future versions, but in the meantime I‚Äôm pretty disappointed that this didn‚Äôt work out the way I was hoping.",I was surprised and disappointed to find that I don‚Äôt like it as much as I was hoping to.,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1ahp6yx/i_was_surprised_and_disappointed_to_find_that_i/

1.  I wish the windows had a transparency option.  I‚Äôm sitting in a classroom setting, think college teacher/lecture and find it hard with the focused window completely covering the professor.  Some side windows are transparent, some are not.  But the ability to set all at a 60% opacity would be amazing.  Trying to place around a professor has you ending up positioning your head at bad angles.

2. Bluetooth Magic Keyboard and trackpad are amazing.  But as I type this my typing hand has started to move the mouse cursor as I type.  Also I‚Äôve noticed when going to hand movements after trackpad can be a little buggy.

3. RAM.  I have no idea how many apps this thing can handle, I need a resource manager to know how much free RAM is available.  I‚Äôve definitely seen things bog down and forced to close some apps.

It was in the official case, not charging, the battery plugged in, on, and I took it out after a couple days of not being used and there was a small crack in the center bottom. I posted here and contacted apple support. They said to bring it into the store for diagnosis. People here said there is about 8 other headsets that developed the same crack in almost the exact same spot. 

Still no explanation for what causes the crack but it seems to be limited to only about a dozen headsets. 

A few days later someone from Apple support reached back out to collect more info and make sure I was getting it taken care of. He was very friendly and sounded concerned and curious. He contacted me another time to help me schedule an appt at the Apple Store. He also had me send in diagnostics info from the headset and got the serial number of the travel case. 

Last night I went to my appt at the Irvine Apple Store. They had heard of the cracked headsets but hadn‚Äôt seen one. They let me exchange it for a new headset in store and in about half an hour I was walking out with a new Apple Vision Pro with the 21w light seal I wanted! 

They still don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs causing it but it also seems to still be affecting a very small number of devices. Apple took it seriously and handled it very well. It‚Äôs been an interesting experience and I hope it doesn‚Äôt happen to any more!

It‚Äôs not the weight (which is a problem but will come down over time), or the size (which will shrink with each iteration), or the worry that it will drive us to consume more content alone (almost half of Americans already watch TV alone). Or how tech giants like Meta, Netflix, Spotify, and Google are currently withholding their apps from the device. (Content creators may come around once the consumers are there, and some, like Disney, are already embracing the device, making 150 movies available in 3D, including from mega-franchises like¬†*Star Wars*¬†and Marvel.) And it‚Äôs not even the price, because if Apple wanted to, the company could subsidize the cost of the Apple Vision Pro and it would have about as much financial impact as Cook losing a nickel between his couch cushions.

I‚Äôm talking about something that I don‚Äôt see a solution for.

I first recognized the problem when I was at Apple Park, in the basement offices of SJT. I was seeing yet another demo, this time in Joshua Tree, where I sat in the striking desert silhouette of the arid landscape. I played Fruit Ninja, where I got to slice fruit with my bare hands. Then I tried a DJ app, where a turntable opened in front of me and I could slide the fader, tweak the mixer, and scratch the records, and I summoned a disco ball that magically clung to the ceiling as animated ravers danced around me.

In the middle of my DJ set, an Apple employee said it was time to wrap up. I took the Apple Vision Pro off, and that‚Äôs when it hit me. The problem. It happened again at home, scrolling through the spatial videos I‚Äôve taken of my kids over the last few weeks, seeing them as if they‚Äôre actually in front of me. And it‚Äôs going to happen in a few minutes, when I finish writing this article and the Word document in front of me the size of an IMAX screen goes away.

**When I take it off, every other device feels flat and boring:** **My 75-inch OLED TV feels like a CRT from the ‚Äô90s; my iPhone feels like a flip phone from yesteryear, and even the real world around me feels surprisingly flat.** And this is the problem. In the same way that I can‚Äôt imagine driving a car without a stereo, in the same way I can‚Äôt imagine not having a phone to communicate with people or take pictures of my children, in the same way I can‚Äôt imagine trying to work without a computer, I can see a day when we all can‚Äôt imagine living without an augmented reality. When we‚Äôre enveloped more and more by technology, to the point that we crave these glasses like a drug, like we crave our iPhones today but with more desire for the dopamine hit this resolution of AR can deliver.

I know deep down that the Apple Vision Pro is too immersive, and yet all I want to do is see the world through it.""",Vanity Fair - The Problem with the Vision Pro,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1age872/vanity_fair_the_problem_with_the_vision_pro/
Marnip,1707000086.0,,1ai8d7m,t3_1ai8d7m,154,366,"When I first got the Apple Vision Pro yesterday I thought ‚ÄúThis is so cool but I find some of these issues are deal breakers‚Ä¶ looks like I might return.‚Äù My head became tired after using the solo band and I found interacting with the interface confusing and a pain at times. I was getting frustrated and went to bed with negative thoughts.

However, after waking up today and working in it. I‚Äôm really starting to think I will keep it.

What Changed

- Comfort: USE THE DUAL LOOP BAND AND THE W+ OR N+. I cannot stress this enough if you are having issues with it being heavy in the front. I believe Apple defaulted to the Solo Knit Band because it looks sexier but the dual looper band helps immensely with weight. I think Apple wanted to release this as a standard design for future generations and plan to lower the weight of the device but for right now, just do it and thank me later. With the dual loop band on the weight is not an issue at all. Further, switching to the W+ or N+ already included in your box is a game changer. Apple provides that this is just if you think your eyes are too close to the display. However, using this eye seal cushion helps with 2 things: (1) more padding for your face and (2) eye fatigue. I had pressure points around my face with the normal light seal but after changing to the W+, all the pain on my face went away. Further, eye fatigue seemed to have improved because my eyes weren‚Äôt as close. 

- Controls: When I first was using the Vision Pro, I was annoyed by how some of the eye tracking and pinching. However, after working on it, I have gotten better and better at focusing on what I actually want to click on and how the system works. I like to compare it to when I first got a MacBook. I didn‚Äôt understand the gestures and thought ‚Äúthis is stupid and hard af to control.‚Äù However, after working on it, you continually get better at how the UI works and responds to what you are doing. For me, I have now gotten extremely good at it and feel as though it ‚Äúknows what I‚Äôm about to do‚Äù as I‚Äôve gotten used to how it works. I will say the number one problem you need to work on is looking at something you want to click on and clicking before moving your eyes away. It‚Äôs a bit odd the first few times but you quickly become used to it.

- Productivity: This is what I bought the Vision Pro for. I will say that using this with a MacBook Pro is amazing. Bringing up the screen and using the keyboard and touchpad from the MacBook increases your use of the Vision Pro by an exponential amount. Further, for those who say they can‚Äôt see their screen, you can always adjust the text size on your MacBook and Vision Pro at any time and this will help. I had LASIK done previously so never needed glasses or contacts but make sure your vision is corrected before complaining haha.

- Media: I had the same complaint like others that there were reflections when watching media. However, that is a limitation of the lenses on any headset. Something that helps with this is to view content in bright environments. For example, watch a video while using a daytime environment. I have had no real reflections then. I will say the use of the pancake lenses in the Vision Pro is much better than the fresnel lenses from prior headsets. Like night and day better. Avoid watching media in the dark if the reflections really annoy you.

- Siri: USE SIRI. I cannot stress this enough use your babe Siri. She isn‚Äôt as dumb as she used to be and can be extremely useful instead of navigating through the UI. Ask her to open an app, alter volume, etc. ONE OF HER BEST USE CASES IS TO CLEAR ALL APPS IN YOUR VISION PRO. My first day I kept opening apps and would randomly have apps open everywhere in my house. Using Siri to close all of the apps is a godsend. Simply say ‚ÄúSiri, close all apps‚Äù and boom, your house is clean again‚Ä¶ If only actually cleaning the house was that simple.

- Passthrough: Passthrough was about what I expected. I see many people saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs so bad‚Äù etc. However, compared to other headsets Vision Pro is light years ahead and actually allows you to do something and then go back to using the Vision Pro. Is it perfect and like real life? no but the fact it is usable and accurate is amazing. Further, the cameras need good lighting to do a good job with Passthrough. 

- Last Bit of Advice: Don‚Äôt make quick judgments. You have 2 weeks to play with this thing and see if you like it or not. Don‚Äôt wear it once and be like ‚Äúthis sucks.‚Äù Try it for a bit and get used to how to use it. There is no reason to rush to judgments and you have plenty of time to return if you want. Half of the Vision Pro is learning how to use it and get used to it. I will say I‚Äôm guilty of having a bad mood about it but after practicing with it and learning the gestures and features, I can say I‚Äôll likely keep it.

ImmortalGoy,1708653655.0,,1axooi8,t3_1axooi8,185,365,"TL;DR - Wanted to exchange my light seal, they said they could only exchange the whole device, so i got a brand new AVP.

For context, this Apple store is in a relatively wealthy area, also I was 5 days past my 14 day return window. I walked in last Friday to exchange my 25W light seal for a 21W, that was a circus (see my last post). Anyway they were out of stock so they told me to keep checking online over the next few days for their inventory to refresh. I saw today that they were back in stock, so I go in for an exchange. I tell the employee the whole story about how I came in last Friday and how i‚Äôm technically outside of my return window but they said I would be able to exchange my light seal anyway. He hears me out, then he asks for the serial number, clicks around on his device for a bit, then tells me ‚ÄúOkay, hold on for just a sec‚Äù, and goes and talks to a couple other employees. Then he comes back and the conversation went like this:

Apple employee - ‚ÄúAlright so we don‚Äôt actually have a way in our system to *only* exchange your light seal, so we‚Äôre going to have to do a like-for-like exchange of the entire device.‚Äù 

Me - ‚Äú‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù

Them - ‚ÄúYep‚Äù

Me - ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre gonna take my used device and give me‚Ä¶ a different used one?‚Äù 

Them - ‚ÄúNope, brand new device, with the 21W light seal.‚Äù

Me (chuckling) - ‚ÄúOkay, sure‚Äù

The funny thing is that I didn‚Äôt have any of the original packaging with me, let alone the accessories. They even gave me a new travel case. I walked out of that store baffled as to what just happened. All I needed was a different light seal but I ended up with a brand new AVP plus a few extra accessories. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up with my local Apple store but it seems they are extremely strict about adhering to their system. Better yet, maybe he was just being a bro ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I started off with the Dinosaur thing. Got super excited. Was utterly in awe.  

(Keep in mind I‚Äôve never seen any virtual reality before).  

Then I loaded up the Yosemite environment.  I felt this insane endorphin rush wash over my entire body.  I‚Äôm 49 years old and literally nothing stimulates me anymore. 

Feeling this sensation was just confusing - and wonderful. 

Especially when I figured out how to make the environment wrap around behind me. I just sat there dumbfounded.  Mouth literally hanging open.  I was no longer in my living room and some tech device had managed to actually convince me of that.  

My head filled with thousands of usecases for this tech.  Mental health benefits.  Work and study.  Meditation.  Depression healing.  I could feel warmth and endorphins just washing over me. 

It was uncomfortable, and amazing.

Then I found the immersive videos inside Apple TV. The preview one that shows you snaps of all the different videos they‚Äôve made. 

I think I made it as far as the tightrope walker before I had to take the thing off of my head.  

I was freaking out.  Making embarrassing noises.  Mouth wide open.  Moaning in disbelief.  Praying none of my neighbors could hear, or see me through a window.  

These videos hit me so hard that I couldn‚Äôt contain the emotions I was having. It was unexpected.  Disorienting.  Exhilarating.  And wonderful. I ripped the thing off my head, set it down beside me on the couch, and just had to stop and compose myself for a minute.  I was crying, and had no idea why.  Except a feeling of intense ‚Äúwonder‚Äù.  I felt so stupid.  

Someone here recently said:  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sex for the eyes‚Äù.

It‚Äôs that and more. This thing is going to change the world.  What‚Äôs coming is going to transform society.  Make people feel like they‚Äôve been catapulted 60 years into the future, overnight.

I just noticed that, when I took off my headset after getting tired enough to sleep, going back to my phone felt like a real downgrade. With my phone, I only have one small screen, and I have to hold it.

I think this is the sign that the headset really is the future. When I‚Äôd rather be using it over my phone, for the same things I do with my phone, it‚Äôs clear that headsets like the Vision Pro are the next technological step up.

I don‚Äôt use my Vision Pro the same way I‚Äôve used other VR headsets. I use it the same way I use my phone. 

What‚Äôs sad is the Quest could‚Äôve gotten me to use it that way too, but that‚Äôs where Apple‚Äôs talent for creating great software shines. The Quest UI just didn‚Äôt make me want to stay in there over relaxing on my phone.

helpimalive24,1706970566.0,,1ahxbxt,t3_1ahxbxt,281,341,"For background, I am a tech enthusiast who has owned/used multiple VR headsets. I am firmly planted in the Apple ecosystem but wouldn't consider myself a huge fangirl. I was interested in the AVP for both productivity and entertainment. Prior to this, I only used VR headsets for entertainment.

I picked one up yesterday shortly after the store opened and have used it for about 12 hours total. This included watching a 3D movie while in full immersion in Disney+, watching TV in pass-through via Plex,  general web-browsing/doom-scrolling, and working with a multiple window/Mac setup. Below are my pros/mehs/cons summary.

&#x200B;

**Pros:** 

\- Screen quality is insane. There is absolutely zero-screen door effect and the clarity looks very very close to using something like a MBP or iPad/iPhone screen in real life. It is truly incredible the leap this is over other headsets.

\- Integration with your other Apple products is great. I have all of my messages, photos, etc. synced. Aside from regular phone calls (which I'm sure will be added at some point), there really is no reason to have to remove your headset and use your phone. Hooking it up to my macbook and using it as an external monitor works flawlessly, and despite the one-monitor limitation I am able to do everything I need to do for work when supplemented with Vision OS apps.

\- Hand/eye tracking is amazing. Not perfect, but still amazing. The freedom of not having to carry controllers around with you is huge. I never liked using my Quest while sitting in bed or on an airplane because of having to use/find a place for controllers. This is definitely the future of headsets and I can't imagine wanting to use one that requires controllers again.

\- Immersion is fantastic and really benefits from spatial audio. Despite some cons you will see below, overall this is by far the most immersive VR experience I've had. When I am in full immersion mode and listening to spatial audio, it really feels like I've been transported somewhere else.

&#x200B;

**Mehs:**

\- Pass-through clarity is servicable. It's not nearly as good as what marketing materials showed, which is expected, but definitely worse than my expectations after watching the reviews. I am listing this as neither a pro nor con, because as I said it's serviceable. I can use it to grab the drink from my side table when I'm in bed, or to move between rooms in my house, but I see no reason to want to keep the headset on while doing things not in Vision OS. 

\- Battery tethering is not a huge issue. I don't like that it exists, but definitely better than having it integrated and adding to the weight.  


**Cons:**

\- FOV is probably the biggest disappointment. The Verge review is actually pretty accurate regarding the ""binoculars"" feel. It distracts from the immersion, which as good as it is currently, would be so much better with a wider FOV. I am surprised this was not mentioned in more reviews. It makes the prospect of having tons of huge windows open at once not as enticing when the FOV is this limiting. I have to move my head around far more than I would like when using multiple windows for work.

\- Comfort is a problem. It's a heavy device that hangs on your face. I have used both straps extensively as well as tried 6+ light seals in store to get the right fit, and it still gets noticeably uncomfortable after about 1-1.5 hours into a session. A halo strap would likely help a lot, but those are bulky and inelegant.  Also, I find my eyes dry out pretty easily in this headset compared to others. 

\- Lens glare is bad. This is especially prevalent when looking at bright things while immersed in a dark environment. I can ignore it most times, but it can be really distracting and takes away from the quality of the screen. Trying different light seals/cushions/straps doesn't help.   


**Summary:**  


Overall, I am simultaneously impressed with the device and disappointed. The technology is amazing, but there are still many inherent limitations of a VR headset that cause issues. If any company could overcome them, it would be Apple, but I had expected more improvements than what was released. 

I was hoping the AVP would be something I could use for most of my day.  However, I found myself still taking it off and using my phone for doom-scrolling and my iPad for web browsing while lounging. For work, having the giant screens is great, but the limited FOV and the weight of the device causes me to switch back to just using my MBP after 1-2 hours. The only use case where I didn't want to switch from the AVP was watching TV/movies, but eventually I had to due to comfort.

The AVP offers a really compelling glimpse into the future of AR/VR, but ultimately I think it needs at least another generation or two before it's something that will become a significant part of my daily routine. Will I be keeping it? Most likely, but I am surprised it's a question I am even asking myself.

You can literally just slide it on, and clip on the top solo knit band just like the regular band.The STL file is available for download on Thingiverse: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6470452](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6470452)Feel free to ""Tip the designer"" on that page! :D

&#x200B;

For the moment, if you order/purchase a solo knit band from Apple I do recommend the small version. When you fit it on, be sure that the top band is sitting on the top of your head, not towards your forehead, otherwise the sizing might not work.Almost forgot: The design is reversible! If the strap is still too loose, flip the clips upside down (one side only, or both of them).

Any questions, just let me know!

For those of you without 3d printers... I'm trying to figure out logistics ATM. I got a LOT of messages, I hear you. I want to make the shipping as smooth (and as cheap) as possible.

Update: If you'd like to order one, for the moment, just DM me with your name and address. As soon as the ball gets rolling I'll reply with a payment link.

Update 2: First batch went out to folks today. Second batch tomorrow.

Update 3: After shipping out multiple batches, I am no longer taking orders. I hope I helped out as many people as I could, but printing + shipping these take up a big part of my day and I have many other commitments. Thanks so much for all the support! I recommend checking out all the other new clips that people have designed, most are available for ordering.

emseearr,1707283058.0,,1akvdkt,t3_1akvdkt,131,296,"A guy I work with brought their Vision Pro to work today and was letting anyone try it out.

In the morning before my first meeting, he was at his desk with about five or six people gathered, each taking turns while he walked them through getting setup in guest mode, some of the different apps and experiences, and the mechanics of getting around in the OS.

I had back-to-back meetings scheduled because this is the only day I don‚Äôt wfh, so I didn‚Äôt get a chance to try it for myself, but I was actively eavesdropping as everyone else gave it a go.

There are about 200 people on our floor, and every time I got out of a meeting, I‚Äôd see another gaggle lined up to try it.

My pod is tech-centric, we work on the app and website for a major company, but there are teams on our floor that are focused on other parts of the business and not as tech-oriented, people of all ages from different teams were trying it out all day.

If I had to sum up what I overheard, it was just utter amazement all around. People seemed to immediately ‚Äúget it‚Äù and quickly figured out how to navigate and really enjoyed the experience. They‚Äôd go back to their desk and tell the person sitting next to them how cool it was, and how ‚Äúreal‚Äù things looked.

Toward the end of the day, the guy who brought the Vision Pro in handed it over to the person who is the ‚Äúbig boss‚Äù for our app and website. He was sitting in the cube adjacent to mine with the Vision Pro on while the owner gave him some pointers and got him setup.

I watched the ‚Äúbig boss‚Äù sitting there, pawing, swiping, and pinching his fingers at the air, repeatedly muttering ‚Äúholy shit‚Äù and squealing as he tried out different apps. It was obvious he was really enjoying it and impressed by the experience. This guy is pretty hard to please, so to hear and see him be so delighted by anything was surprising. He got the most time with the device of anyone today, probably about 20-30 minutes.

I‚Äôm still a little bummed I didn‚Äôt elbow in and give it a try at some point, I didn‚Äôt even get a good look at the hardware, just glimpses as I walked by the owner‚Äôs desk between meetings.

Overall I was struck by how quickly people seemed to get oriented in the experience. Some sat down near the owner‚Äôs desk, but others walked around the office with it on, and I didn‚Äôt hear anyone say a single negative thing about the device (not related to the price anyway). People were awestruck by this thing in a way I have not seen since the first iPhone. It seemed really ‚Äúnew‚Äù and fun.

It was an interesting day, even though I was only eavesdropping. It really seems like it won over a lot of people today, though the price will probably inhibit many from getting one for now.

The owner mentioned he had been taking Teams calls on it, so I might ring him sometime tomorrow just to see his persona üòÇ",Someone in my office brought theirs to work today ‚Ä¶,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1akvdkt/someone_in_my_office_brought_theirs_to_work_today/

ConclusionOk2353,1709355253.0,,1b4fxyb,t3_1b4fxyb,58,295,"My beloved dog passed away yesterday. He's been my best friend and my beacon of light and love for the past 11 years, and ever since the AVP was announced I hoped that I would be able to capture as much of my time with him as possible in 3D. I knew time was running out because he was slowing down, and he was diagnosed with heart failure late last year. When the iOS beta came out I upgraded immediately so that I could start capturing spatial videos on my iPhone.

It's been so painful losing my best friend. I did not think myself capable of so much heartbreak. But today I was able to revisit some of our walks and silly memories together, and it brought me so much comfort to know that I'll always have these few moments close to remember him by. I smiled, I laughed, watching him again. Uni - I'm going to miss you so much. You were the best dog I could have ever hoped for. Thank you for your love, you've taught me so much about love and how to be a better person. I love you and I miss you already more than anything in the world. Rest in peace bud bud. You're the sweetest and bestest dog in the whole world. I never loved anyone or anything as much as you.

I was there with iPhone OS 2.0. The app store didn't have ""editorial"" - it had charts. Lists. Every single new app got 10 minutes of fame on the new apps list. Currently popular apps (from the last 24 hours) could be found on the top paid/top free apps lists. And even more so - there were categories. And every category had it's own respective lists. Users built the app store alongside developers, by having the ability to find and push the best content to the top. Apple has become so full of themselves that they can no longer see what made the app store great in the first place. 

Now what do we have for visionOS? If you go to the search tab you can see editorialized ""collections"" of the same apps that were advertised in the first editorials on the main app store page. Categories? Why would you want to browse software collections? 

I love the device, but I'm very worried about the software ecosystem for this very reason - iPad apps going to VP have no incentive because VP users already bought the app on other Apple platforms. And bespoke new apps have to be the ""chosen"" by Apple editorial, or they just go into the app store void. Getting press for a visionOS app is going to be 10x harder in normal media because the media outlets are still going to focus on iPhone/iPad/Mac as that is where their readership exists.

I really, really wanted to love this thing. Thought I‚Äôd share why I am sadly returning it:

1. **Comfort** \- this really is the #1 thing. I went to the Apple Store twice to get different light seals, got close to something that felt good, but ultimately I did not want to spend extended periods of my time with this on my face. It was so cool when I first got it and I‚Äôd be excited to put it on whenever I got home to explore. But now it feels like a chore, after just a few days. I can‚Äôt imagine wanting to strap this on my face to do real work. I actually found the solo loop more comfortable than the dual loop, but even with that, it‚Äôs more pleasant to go about my day without the weight on my face. My face may be different from your face - so your mileage, of course, may vary.
2. **Reflections** \- I know this is to be expected with this type of lens, but the reflections in dark environments really got to me. It just wasn‚Äôt more pleasant to watch a movie in AVP compared to a big TV at home.
3. **Size** \- I absolutely LOVE the AVP case. It‚Äôs gorgeous. But when traveling (something I was looking forward to with AVP), it‚Äòs just too big. I love one-bagging (just taking a big backpack), which can fit my laptop fine, but obviously AVP requires its own case. I‚Äôm really looking forward to the day when we have glasses small enough to slip into your bag.
4. **Philosophy** \- I enjoy being on the bleeding edge of technology and being an early adopter, but I have to agree with the Verge review here: the real world is simply better than the virtual world. I don‚Äôt have deep philosophical objections to mixed/augmented reality, but I just don‚Äôt love the idea of spending the majority of my working day in mixed reality, at least not yet. And if I‚Äôm not using this for productivity, and if I don‚Äôt love it for entertainment, and if there aren‚Äôt enough games to play on it - I just can‚Äôt justify keeping it.

To be clear: Vision Pro is a technological marvel. I really do think the eye tracking is second to none, and the interface is so deeply satisfying to use. Perhaps if there were a larger app ecosystem at launch, I‚Äôd have been happier to keep it (e.g. for shorter experiences, like gaming, that I‚Äôd use it in shorter bursts for). But for work and entertainment, it just isn‚Äôt there yet. I want to lay back on my couch and play my PS5, or sit at my big desktop and work on a crisp 4K monitor. I don‚Äôt want to put a machine on my face - at least not yet.

fox-mcleod,1705527131.0,,1998eja,t3_1998eja,154,242,"As we get closer to pre-order, I‚Äôve seen a lot of people looking to make a decision asking/speculating about what the ‚ÄúKiller App‚Äù is that makes me want to get one. And I‚Äôve even seen more and more concern about how there is no ‚Äúkiller app‚Äù yet. 


I decided to share my thoughts since I firmly believe there isn‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt be a ‚Äúkiller app‚Äù.

I was one of the first people to have an iPhone in 2007. But unlike most people who had one I didn‚Äôt have any other Apple products, I didn‚Äôt have a lot of money to spend on new gadgets, I didn‚Äôt even have a cell phone yet.

I got an iPhone in 2007, because I‚Äôve been needing an iPhone since about 2003 and I was sick of waiting. You see, the iPhone didn‚Äôt have a killer app. What it had was a distinct singular value proposition the entire rest of the design derived from. The iPhone was **the internet in your pocket**. I knew that‚Äôs what it was from how they talked about it and so I knew now was the time to get a cell phone. 

Before the iPhone, I had tried all kinds of other solutions. Not other cell phones ‚Äî *because that‚Äôs not what the iPhone is*. I tried these things we‚Äôve long since forgotten called PDAs made by companies we don‚Äôt talk about anymore like the Palm Pilot or the Sony Treo. 

The same basic thing is true for the iPod. At the time, other companies were building ‚Äúmp3 players‚Äù. And I got suckered into buying a Dell Axim over an iPod by Tom‚Äôs guide or some other publication who made the mistake of putting specs side by side and assuming that‚Äôs what makes the product. 

Sure, the Dell had more storage, but get what else it had‚Ä¶ up and down buttons and a folder system ‚Äî an absolute nightmare for navigating around a large amount of songs (which renders the larger storage pointless). The clickwheel and the UX to reinvent MP3 management is what made the iPod, **all your music in your pocket**.  

##So what is the Apple Vision Pro?

The AVP is not a ‚ÄúVR‚Äù headset anymore than an iPhone is a PDA and comparing specs is as silly as it was when the Dell Axim Jukebox ‚Äúoutperformed‚Äù the iPod. The AVP is a whole new category no one has ever tried before ‚Äî but I‚Äôve been asking for years. **The Apple Vision Pro is a hands/desk free computer**. 

Why would I want a desk and hands free computer? In product management, we call these ‚ÄúUser journeys/needs‚Äù:

- As someone who often works from home, I want to take video conferences while I straighten up around the house. I don‚Äôt want to be tied to a desk
- As someone who sits all day working, I want to be able to get up and walk around while I give my brain some time off to watch a movie
- As someone who cooks for a family, I want to have my hands free while I look up recipes 
- As someone with a young child, I want to be able to quickly keep an eye on her without being stuck in one room of the house while working
- As someone who gets bored easily, I want to be able to ~~doom~~scroll Reddit while I fold laundry

I can‚Äôt do any of that with any other VR system because what they are isn‚Äôt a hands free computer. They are an immersive gaming platform. 

How do I know the Apple Vision Pro is a hands free computer? The choices they made:

- In order to be a desk free computer, it has to be at least as good as a normal computer which means it cannot leave me blind to the outside world. The entire system was built around looking through the AVP like you‚Äôre looking through glass
- In order to be a hands free computer, it cannot rely on controllers. They made it purely gesture based for a reason. 
- In order to take that conference call while cleaning around the house, I need it to solve the awkward ‚Äúwhere is my head‚Äù problem. They sure put a lot of hardware together to make this one specific thing work. 

Everything Apple focused on pointed at one specific killer *application* ‚Äî the entire system. The entire system is built around bringing computation into an ambient, hands free, desk free, ubiquitous experience. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm getting it. 

We won‚Äôt know if Apple will be successful yet. At this price point it really is still an experiment. And the most important inflection point will probably be in how much public acceptance there is.",Why I‚Äôm getting the Apple Vision Pro: thoughts from a product designer,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1998eja/why_im_getting_the_apple_vision_pro_thoughts_from/

Almost everyone is referencing the Verge video when they say they are disappointed.

Let‚Äôs tackle the key issues there:

- they complained about FOV saying it looks like binoculars 

No one else has ever said that. The FOV by all other accounts has never been an issue.

- they complained about the color range stating you can only see 49% of the colors humans can see.

Everyone has also stated how colorful and beautiful the displays are. This is hardly a concern

- they complained about resolution

Yet everyone has said how fantastic the passthrough and displays are. They mentioned a big caveat ‚Äúuse at night‚Äù. Yes cameras don‚Äôt see that well at night.

- they complained about it being a VR headset, nothing revolutionary 

No headset can do what this does. In the same way this tricks your brain into things there‚Äôs something 3D in front of your eyes, it tricks you into thinking there‚Äôs true AR. It‚Äôs all the AR you‚Äôll need.

- they complained about personas and how bad they looked

I thought they looked amazing. I could tell exactly who each person is and the expressions and gestures seemed natural

Finally, the overarching theme‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs magic, until it‚Äôs not‚Äù

He said that while things were new everything was amazing, but after you get used to it you start to notice the buggy times.

Duh‚Ä¶ of course. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt still magical.

If you have watched this persons opinions on VP before the actual review‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll note the distaste for it. He has never liked this headset.

The video production was fantastic, and he said lots of good things about it, but overall the video was negatively biased.

Brian Tong did not fan boy, he showed you what it could do, and presented you with all the honest drawbacks at the end. The video was awesome, and should leave us feeling excited for the future!

SpatialCompooper,1709766044.0,,1b8e4yx,t3_1b8e4yx,75,233,"From when i was a very young child I was obsessed with movies. My mom use to take me to the movies a lot. We would ‚Äúmovie hop‚Äùlol. She would buy tickets for her, myself and sometimes a friend of mine for one movie. Then after the movie ended we would go to the lobby, buy new refreshments (usually kept the staff from stopping us) then we would go see another movie without buying new tickets (there were no assigned seats in those days, just first come first serve). Sometimes we would watch three or four movies in one day. 

In any event, the idea of having a movie theatre all to myself was a fantasy that I have obsessed about since then. Not a ‚Äúhome theatre‚Äù, as impressive as those can be, but a proper movie theatre. I saw Dr. Strange in 3d IMAX a few years back and left the theatre sad. Not because i didn‚Äôt like the movie, just the opposite, I was enchanted by some of the Jack Kirby inspired visuals. I was sad because I knew that no matter what I did, I could never recreate that experience after it left theatres. 

I have friends that have a ‚Äúdream car‚Äù that they‚Äôve always wanted. Maybe they obesess about having a yacht or private plane. All of these things are attainable. The idea of having a private IMAX theatre was a concept that just wasn‚Äôt possible. Until I got my AVP.

I have tried many headsets before and while I had come close to simulating that experience, it was just not quite there. Even more frustrating than accepting the impossibility of something is getting within inches of your dream but falling short. 

I‚Äôm a grown man and i couldn‚Äôt help but get misty eyed when I first experienced movies in the AVP. Finally, after all  of these years I experienced that same feeling i had in multiple theaters before. That pure joy and excitement one only feels when they are tapping into their inner child. 

This ‚Äúsilly, overpriced, heavy, weird looking, battery dangling‚Äù, but borderline magical device made my childhood dream come true for just under four thousand dollars. Thats a damn good value in my book.

sml0820,1707019399.0,,1aiewr5,t3_1aiewr5,37,224,"I bought the Apple 15 Pro Max IPhone , and spatial video recording was released mid December for the Pro Max. A few days after spatial video recording was released, my wife gave birth to our second baby. I was able to record all the moments leading up to, through the birth, and all the moments over the holidays, with family and friends visiting to see the new little guy. I was able to record his older brother‚Äôs first reaction to meeting his new baby brother, all in spatial video. 

I sat down last night after receiving the Vision Pro, Apple‚Äôs Headset, and I created an album from all the spatial videos I created.  A month or so ago, I remember listening to some reviews on YouTube regarding the Vision Pro in which they said spatial video was a bit gimmicky and may only be good for recording up close food videos. I can assure you this reviewer did not record as important of life moments as the birth of the child.  When you have a baby everything is such a sleep deprived whirlwind.  I got to relive the biggest moments as if I was there, which kept me up well past my bed time from the experience. The next day I then set on my original plan and added a Valentine‚Äôs Day card at the end of the album. I set my wife up in guest mode. She just sat there and relived the moments surrounding the birth of our son, as if she was back in the moment. In fact her watching and crying was a memory in itself, so you guessed it, I recorded it in spatial video on my Iphone.

**HOUR 1:**

Unboxing, literally just unboxing the thing. We‚Äôre all pretty used to the quality of Apple packaging, but I felt physical pain recycling this box after it was all taken out.

You get the device with a 1-band strap, a lens cover, a 2-band strap, a polishing cloth (DO NOT LOSE, more details later), the battery, a USB-C to USB-C 1m cable and 30W power adaptor, manuals, and 3.5kg of over engineering beautiful packaging.

PROS:

* beautiful everything
* Incredible quality, everything
* Actually comes with some accessories that we‚Äôve been trained to expect to be sold separately

CONS

* The packaging is very bulky and you may genuinely feel bad about tossing it
* It‚Äôs a bit overwhelming to unbox, there‚Äôs so much stuff and it just keeps coming.

**HOUR 2:**

I sat down in a well lit area and booted up. I got through the calibration which was mostly uneventful. The part for setting up a persona had me stuck for a second. It made me watch a video before it‚Äôd continue to capturing my appearance. Midway through, the video paused itself (or I did by tapping my fingers together.) It paused right as it was concluding the instructions, and right before it got to the end, so I spent several minutes taking the headset off, looking at the lens as per instructed, not getting a reaction, putting it back on and looking around the UI for an indication what to do next. I feel like this happened because the video controls hid themselves so I didn‚Äôt realize it was an actual video you can play, pause, scrub, etc. so I just looked at it like it was going to continue on its own... lesson learned

Once I finally figured it out, my persona came out cross eyed and it gave me Johnny Bravo hair, but I was too eager to get to actual use to try it again, even to this moment of writing.

I booted up the full non-demo post-setup OS. It took me a second to really process what was going on because of how high fidelity the image was, I didn‚Äôt fully grasp the fact that I was looking at a camera feed, not the physical world. The combination of ultra dense pixel resolution, excellent feed stitching from multiple camera inputs, and magical (for lack of a better word) absence of latency, all tricked me into thinking it was just the real world I was looking at.

PROS:

* tech so immersive that you forget you‚Äôre looking at a screen instead of real life

CONS:

* Personas has quite a ways to go
* Noticeable ISO/film grain changes in changing conditions
* A little bit confusing UI during setup

**HOUR 3:**

I jumped straight to some of the demo-esque parts of the OS, in particular, the dinosaur encounter and Apple TV Alicia Keys spatial video. The dinosaur felt a bit gimmicky‚Äî while it DID make me want to reach out and try to touch the animal, I still felt like I wasn't getting the ""I'm really there"" experience. Instead, it felt like a cool, very-3D museum kinda experience. This was further reinforced when I did actually try reaching out. The cutout around my hand was rough and imprecise as it passed in front of the dinosaur image. I realize it'd be a monumental feat to have perfect physical and virtual world layering without a detectable cutout, but compared to just how high fidelity the rest of the experience has been so far, it stood out and was a slight disappointment. That being said, you quickly learn to ignore it. 

I talked about the high fidelity physical world feed, but the true unbelievable experience during this hour was, and still is, just how PERFECTLY virtual objects exist in the physical space. They do not jitter. They do not slip-slide around. They have steadfast anchoring in the exact 3D space in which you place it. You can walk across the house to another room entirely and look back, and you‚Äôll see a ghost of where you left that window open, still in the other room. You can return back and it‚Äôs still right there waiting for you. You can grab the window and walk around with it pinned in your view until you drop it again,  just like picking up any physical thing. I've never seen anything like it, and I didn't expect it to work across the entire floorplan of my house.

While watching the Alicia Keys spatial video, I also had my texts brought up in another window in my little workspace sphere. I was chatting with my partner talking about the experience; I had to go to the restroom but I wanted to finish a thought. So, I grabbed the iMessage box and walked away to the restroom with it, and it hit me how silly and unreal it was to leave a window behind and just know it‚Äôll be there when I get back in virtual space. To realize your virtual workspace is as big as you need it to be. I looked in that direction and laughed to myself and it was just chilling off in the distance. I will say though, I wish there was an ability to make your workspace sphere follow you, versus ONLY being stationary in physical space. If I go for a walk with my device, it'd be nice if my iMessage window walked along with me, but alas. Probably safety concerns therein... (EDIT FROM THE FUTURE: I think the ""Travel Mode"" setting does this. Going to investigate more and update if so.)

Unlike the dinosaur encounter, the Alicia Keys spatial video was highly convincing and totally disorienting in a good way. Also unlike the interactive aspect of dinosaur encounter, you cannot walk around the recorded space, but that difference in quality from 3D rendered to high def video recording made a world of difference. I felt like I was there. I expected smells of that studio to hit you. If something was thrown at me, I know I would have flinched and ducked. Despite not being able to move around in the space it was a near perfect illusion.

I called it a day after that. I did not experience eye strain or fatigue but I was getting soreness and sensitivity in my brow and cheekbones from the weight of the device.

PROS:

* Spatial video has such potential, it hurts that there‚Äôs only limited media produced in that format for now
* The fidelity of virtual overlayed on reality is unparalleled
* The spatial anchoring and position is unshakable and updates are near instant making things feel REAL
* Your space feels infinitely vast, such that you can walk away and windows will continue to exist even after you leave the room
* Seemingly minimal eye fatigue

CONS:

* 3D spatial experiences are still a little gimmicky with much room for improvement
* Cutouts around your hands to separate them from virtual objects are not very precise and prone to jitteriness
* Heavy device with 1-strap band means a bit of pressure and soreness, a general discomfort for your face.
* There isn't an option to make screens move around WITH you. You have to click and drag them along with you, or recenter your view in a new location

**NEXT DAY, HOUR 4-8:**

I sat and watched a full movie, first from a native Vision app like HBO Max, then from a compatible app i.e. Amazon Prime Video. There was no distinguishable difference between the two apps. Compatibility doesn‚Äôt SEEM to be an issue for apps enabled to be used on vision, but I later learned that depends on the app. For now though, I was highly impressed that there didn‚Äôt seem to be a difference. I toyed with resizing, with having a bit of multitasking while I was watching, trying to settle in as I‚Äôm used to with a regular TV on my couch.

A few things stood out. First, environments are annoying when watching movies because they cause very bright ambient light. I realized only after the first movie that the environments have a night mode, and once I figured that out it was no longer an annoyance. So yay apple for remembering night mode features.

Second, after four hours of use things were getting blurry. Mind you, I don‚Äôt wear glasses, I rarely wear sunglasses, so I was confused. It‚Äôs sealed pretty tight so it can‚Äôt be light leak, I didn‚Äôt lay a single finger on the lens so it shouldn‚Äôt be smudged‚Ä¶ I finally got annoyed enough to take it off and realized my nose was somehow getting oils on the lens! I don‚Äôt know if it evaporates and sticks to the closest surface or if my skin is coming into contact with the lenses and I‚Äôm just not realizing it. Here is where you NEED that cleaning cloth because just a few hours of use will have oils starting to coat the lens and disrupt the immersion as things take on a slight light-bloom and eventual distracting smudges.

Third, Spatial Audio is pretty damn incredible. There was a voice behind me in one of the movies and I jumped thinking it was a physical voice. I do miss a bit of the bass depth my usual surround sound system has, but it‚Äôs still very crisp and clear, and can be very loud despite being such small speakers not directly covering or inserted into your ears.

Midway through the second movie, I decided to move from my living room to my bedroom to see if it would be comfortable lying down with the vision. Mostly it is, but there are very sensitive spatial awareness tools that ordinarily prevent you from running into walls or objects. These sensors tend to pick up blankets or pillows bunched up around your head as you lay down, and can disrupt the movie with small proximity warnings. Worst case it REALLY thinks you‚Äôre about to collide with your bedding if it gets too close to your face, and it fades all apps and summons the pass through over your environment and app. So it‚Äôs comfortable to lay in bed, but you have to be careful about bedding objects coming near your face to stay immersed.

Last thing I learned was that you can‚Äôt use vision in a zero-light environment even if you‚Äôre laying down. The device will shut off and give you a warning ‚Äúcannot spatial locate device, please provide light for spatial tracking‚Äù. It hardly matters because you only see the smallest bit of light coming through the light seal so you can leave a light on while wearing it and not super notice, but you DO see a very small light reflection on the inner lenses which is annoying when trying to watch a dark movie. I don‚Äôt know if the device needs to be able to see my environment for its media viewing functionality. But it‚Äôd be nice to have a zero-light setting.

PROS:

* Very high quality Spatial Audio
* Environments are pretty, and they offer night and day versions

CONS:

* Laying down in bed is a little tricky, with proximity sensors picking up bedding and disrupting your media viewing
* The device will shut off if there‚Äôs very low environment lighting
* Skin oils gets into the lenses pretty quickly, causing light bloom and slight blurriness

**HOUR 9:**

I gave movies a rest and tried some TV. Crunchyroll has a vision app that I pulled up and started watching a show, but one episode in, I noticed subtitles started to disappear‚Ä¶ I closed the app and reopened it and they reappeared, but then 10-20 minutes in they disappeared again and suddenly I was noticing UI lagging and jitteriness. Apps weren‚Äôt moving around perfectly smoothly, the tv show video was losing frame rates, the camera was struggling to adjust exposure to environment light levels. I did a full reboot of the device, removed the battery cable for a few seconds and rebooted the device. It was fine for 10-15 more minutes before subtitles went away again and it resumed its lagging and glitching.

Each time this issue arose was while using the crunchyroll app, and would eventually go away when I force quit the app. I cannot tell if the crunchyroll app just isn‚Äôt optimized for this device despite having a vision native app, or if I was just using the device for too long going on 4 consecutive hours of use‚Ä¶ either way kinda disappointing.

Last thing I did while saying goodnight to my partner was try to take some screenshots in my vision to show him what I see. The screenshots significantly reduce the exposure of your virtual environment, so he couldn‚Äôt see the nighttime Yosemite scene I had. It also reduced the field of vision and cropped the image to be smaller than what I was seeing, presumably so the screenshot doesn‚Äôt show the ‚Äúgoggle‚Äù effect around the borders of the device view angle.

I called it a night and went to bed after that.

PROS:

* You can screenshot what you see including windows and apps open to share your exact experience.

CONS:

* Either the device loses speed and power over extended use, or specific apps have the ability to really lag out the device if not properly calibrated to the vision. Either scenario kinda sucks and hopefully Apple or devs get better at optimization for visionOS.
* Screenshots fail to capture your immersive environment well, making virtual environments very low exposure, and severely cropping out your peripherals in the final image.

**NEXT DAY, HOUR 10-12:**

I wanted to give the virtual desktop functionality a try, so I booted up my work MacBook and tried out the screen casting.

It works as expected for the most part, such that you can see the screen and move it and enlarge it and include it seamlessly into your little app sphere in virtual space, but a few issues and areas of improvement.

You cannot gesture or tap in virtual space to interact with the MacBook. There is ecosystem connectivity such as copying and pasting which I‚Äôll get into a but more, but it was a bit disappointing that it‚Äôs basically view-only from the vision device, and you have to use a keyboard and mouse connected to the MacBook to control it.

The ecosystem needs work. You can copy and paste between devices, but you can‚Äôt click and drag. For example, if I have Photo albums open and virtual desktop open, I can‚Äôt drag a photo from my photo album to my Mac. Personally, I‚Äôm surprised because I‚Äôd expect they‚Äôd just treat it as an airdrop, which you CAN do. I can ‚Äúshare‚Äù my photo and choose airdrop and my laptop will be a selectable option, but the gesture of clicking and dragging from my photos window to my Mac virtual desktop window is not a recognizable action.

You also cannot open multiple desktops or emulation multiple monitors with virtual desktop. You can make the one screen very large whereby fitting more windows into the one, but still I‚Äôd like to have separate desktops.

Also, if your desktop goes to sleep, the virtual desktop closes. This isn‚Äôt as much of a big deal if I‚Äôm fully engaged in work, but if I‚Äôm taking a break and texting for a bit, and my MacBook goes to sleep, it‚Äôs annoying to get it set back up.

Last, I‚Äôd like to be able to change monitor aspect ratio. Right now it‚Äôs locked to 16:9 and resizing only changes size fixed to that aspect ratio.

This dissection of virtual desktops is a bit nitpicky, but I‚Äôm hoping you are reading this as ‚Äúall previously-mentioned incredible base functionality aside, here‚Äôs where I‚Äôd like to see it go in the future‚Äù

PROS:

* Having your MacBook in your virtual workspace is incredible
* Some data freely transfers between MacBook and other vision apps
* You can make your screen very large

CONS:

* You cannot use vision gestures to interact with your Mac
* I want multiple virtual desktops
* Dragging and dropping data between virtual desktop and other apps is not a recognized action
* Virtual desktop is stuck at 16:9 aspect ratio
* Computer tends to sleep if you can sidetracked

**HOUR 13-14:**

Wrapped up the last day checking out available games. The selection is sparse for now but that‚Äôs to be expected. They have a beats-saber-esque game that has pretty excellent hand tracking, but this game also highlighted an optimization feature of vision. The device only renders 4K high def video precisely where your eyes are pointed, while the video feed gradually loses fidelity towards your peripherals. Some apps, this video game app included, takes that a bit far and you can see text pixelate and shift around in your peripherals. It causes a bit of dizziness and confusion because the moment you look, it immediately returns to high def while letters in a different peripheral position pixelate out.

I also did a FaceTime call. I was reminded my persona was cross-eyed and funny looking, but I also used the view share function. Instead of them seeing you, they see what you see on their phone through FaceTime. They can see your physical environment, they can see the apps you have open, they get to vicariously experience the fidelity through a window, and my sister and my partner were both highly impressed, excited, engaged and curious. We played around with making stupid persona screenshots, I FaceTimed my mom in and stuck her video feed over top of her physical body to make her look like a bobble head, it was all great fun.

PROS:

* A small handful of Fun games are available
* FaceTime is a very intuitive and fun experience
* Sharing your POV through FaceTime was a pretty flawless experience

CONS:

* Personas are janky and silly
* There‚Äôs a very small app ecosystem at the moment
* Independent devs aren‚Äôt handling the limitations or nuances of the hardware as well as Apple official devs are in their apps. Apple has years of experience fine tuning their app performance during vision‚Äôs development, whereas third party apps aren‚Äôt perfect

**OTHER PEOPLE USING IT:**

Outside of my own use, I had my mother try out a lot of the above functions and got her reactions. With zero tech savviness she struggled with learning the new look and click mechanic but she did get it in time and even became a bit used to it. She played the beat-saber game, she watched the Alicia keys spatial video, and she did the dinosaur encounter. She was hooting and howlering and really enjoyed it overall. She didn‚Äôt realize passthrough was a camera feed and not a lens transparency trick, and couldn‚Äôt quite grasp or believ that concept. She tried typing and had abysmal dexterity, but made it work. Overall as apathetic as she is about tech, even she was impressed and in awe at some specific things.

Like a few others, I just discovered a long crack in the front glass of my Vision Pro. It's been sitting neatly in the Apple travel-case, and it's been subject to very light use a couple of hours a day - I haven't dropped it or similar, which should also be pretty evident from the rest of the glass being completely scratch and dent free. (The white dots are speckles of dust).

I'm traveling currently and not in the US. 

I love the product but this is quite frustrating - anyone else with similar issues or experiences on how to handle this? I won't be back in the US for a bit.

_Avalanche_,1707301587.0,,1akzx3p,t3_1akzx3p,118,201,"After a lot of reading and experimenting (especially with Apple's [Vision Pro Size Help](https://secure7.store.apple.com/shop/vision/fit/help) tool), I realized that most people have it slightly wrong, especially with the first digit.

First of all, [Mystk](https://www.reddit.com/user/MystK/) has already enumerated [all the light seal sizes](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/19ardw5/all_light_seal_sizes/) (all of them come in N/W variants):

* 11, 12, 13, 14
* 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26
* 33, 34, 35, 36

**The first digit refers to how far forward your forehead and cheeks protrude relative to one another.**

* **""2"" is average/typical.**
* **""1"" means your forehead protrudes further forward (relative to your cheeks) than average.**
   * This is why if you start with a 23W in the size help tool, and you specify ""too much pressure on my forehead,"" then it's going to recommend that you switch to 13W.
* **""3"" means your cheeks protrude further forward (relative to your forehead) than average.**
   * This is why if you start with a 23W in the size help tool, and you specify ""too much pressure on either cheek,"" then it's going to recommend that you switch to 33W.

**The second digit refers to how deep the light seal is.** *(Likely relative to your cheek position, not your forehead. If so, this is causing a lot of confusion, since most photos are taken from above.)*

* **""1"" & ""2"" are the shallowest, ""3"" & ""4"" are moderate in depth, and ""5"" & ""6"" are the deepest.**
   * This is why 21W is the most common recommendation, as you want your eyes to be as close to the screen as possible in order to increase your FOV (field of view).
   * This is why 25W is the most common fit for those with Zeiss optic inserts, in order to make some  room for the inserts, but also to make room for the [vertex distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_distance).
      * Speculation: If your eyeglass diopter isn't significant, then this big jump may likely be more than necessary, at the greater expense of decreasing your FOV.
   * This is why if you start with a 23W in the size help tool, and you specify ""I'm receiving a device alert ‚Äî Too Close to Displays,""  then it's going to recommend that you switch to 25W.
   * This is why if you start with a 23W in the size help tool, and you specify ""I'm receiving a device alert ‚Äî Too Far from Displays,""  then it's going to recommend that you switch to 21W.
   * **Dubious speculation: This number may be relative to your cheek position,** which might explain why there are no sizes 15, 16, 31, or 32. (If this is confusing, don't worry about it; it's not important, and I may be wrong. However, I'll elaborate in case it interests you...)
      * For 15 & 16, your forehead is further forward (relative to your cheeks) than most, so simply by choosing a size that starts with ""1"", some depth has already been added for your recessed cheeks. (If any deeper, the bottom of the light seal would be untenably long.)
      * For 31 & 32, your cheeks are further forward (relative to your forehead) than most, so simply by choosing a size that starts with ""3"", some depth has already been subtracted to make room for your protruding cheeks. (If any shallower, the bottom fo the light seal would be untenably short.)
   * **Edit: I'm starting to suspect that odd/even numbers change the shape around the cheek area. This explains why vertical forehead/cheek adjustments either don't change this number, or change it an even number of digits. On the other hand, horizontal nose/temple adjustments change this number an odd number of digits.**
      * If you start with a 23W in the size help tool, and you specify ""too much pressure close to my nose,"" then it's going to recommend that you switch to 24W.
      * If you start with a 24W in the size help tool, and you specify ""too much pressure close to my temple,"" then it's going to recommend that you switch to 23N. \[sic\] (The 23 makes sense to me. The N does not. Something is missing in my understanding.)
         * _Do we have an image that compares, say, 21 vs 23/25, or 22 vs 24/26? (Rather than 21 vs 22/24/26, or 22 vs 23/25.) Evidence either supporting or contradicting this hypothesis is appreciated._

**W/N refers to wide/narrow faces.** (W adds a couple millimeters of width at the temples.)

* This is why if you start with a 23W in the size help tool, and you specify ""it feels too loose or light is coming in,"" then it's going to recommend that you switch to 23N.
* This is why if you start with a 23N in the size help tool, and you specify ""it feels tight and it's squeezing my face"" or ""too much pressure close to my temple,"" then it's going to recommend that you switch to 23W.
* What I *don't* understand, is that if you start with 23W in the size help tool, and you specify ""too much pressure close to my temple,"" then it's going to recommend that you switch to a 23N. \[sic\] Huh, what? (Is this a bug? This directly contradicts the prior bullet point's suggestion.)

**W/N vs W+/N+ light seal cushions:**

* **W+/N+ don't actually add any extra cushioning, only extra depth.**
   * ""Huh?"" For example, try squeezing both a W and W+ with your fingers. The W+ will squeeze about the same amount as the W insert, until you hit something harder embedded inside the W+. Surprise! After realizing this, I stopped using the + cushions, in order to increase my FOV.

The 23 size was used in most of my tests because of how it overlaps with the available 13 and 33 sizes. In cases where there was no equivalent (e.g., 21 has no 31 equivalent, and 25 has no 15 equivalent), then the size help tool will sort of just do its best:

* This is why if you start with a 25W in the size help tool, and you specify ""too much pressure on my forehead,"" then it's going to recommend that you switch to 13W. (Or from 26W to 14W. Why not switch to 14W for both? Because I speculate that odd/even numbers for the second digit separately change the shape around the cheek area in order to provide horizontal adjustments between the nose and temple.)
* This is why if you start with a 21W in the size help tool, and you specify ""too much pressure on either cheek,"" then it's going to recommend that you switch to 33W. (Or from 22W to 34W. Why not switch to 33W for both? Again, because I speculate that odd/even numbers for the second digit separately change the shape around the cheek area in order to provide horizontal adjustments between the nose and temple.)

I'm sure I still have some details/nuances wrong, but I hope we're getting a bit closer to decoding this. In the spirit of [Cunningham's Law](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham's%20Law), tell me where I'm wrong.

Launch Day -  
Man, the pass through is not what I expected.  The FOV is pretty bad, the weight‚Ä¶how am I supposed to use this for prolong amounts of time?  Had company over, couldn‚Äôt spend much time in it.
  
Launch night -  
Escaped to my office after the kids went to sleep. Tested mirroring my Mac. Damn this is cool.  But can i really be productive? I‚Äôll really test on Monday. 90% chance I return this thing. 
  
Day 2 -  
Had company over, couldn‚Äôt spend too much time in it, tried a few more apps.  This thing still hurts.  Dual loop hurts more than the solo loop. What the heck?
  
Night 2 -  
Okay, laying in bed, I can sorta position myself to just use it.  Started an Apple TV+ Show, and answered work emails.  Okay, this thing is kinda cool. Escaped to my office to try encounter dinosaurs.  HOLY FUCKING SHIT. This is nuts. But, still may return it. 80% I will do that. 
  
Day 3 (Sunday) -  
Think I‚Äôm getting the hang of this thing, but still have guests staying over the house.  Can‚Äôt wait till tonight and tomorrow to drive this thing.  Oh! Learned that if I take the light seal off, the FOV is amazing! And it‚Äôs no longer heavy.  
  
Oh, and while in an immersive environment, and people fade in, they look high def as heck!  Pass through does not look grainy. Almost like the video quality can ramp up due to the small amount of actual camera video required to use.  Very impressed with that. Will need to test more. 
  
Night 3 -  
Okay, trying with just the 2 cushions on top of each other, no light seal. This is DOPE. 7/10 comfy, weight is no problem.  Watching a ton of that Apple TV+ show in bed.  Scrolling Reddit, playing with other apps.   Tried Mindfulness while in the dark desert environment, looking at the stars in bed.  OH MY GOD. I had some sort of breakthrough internally through deep focus and concentration. Never felt anything like that before.  I legit cried in the damn thing. What the hell happened?  Okay, I want to keep it, but can I use it for work?  Still 80% chance I will return this.  
  
Day 4 (Monday) -  
Only got to try it for a bit.  Tried with just the 2 cushions, was kinda janky, put the Light Seal back on, tunnel vision but kinda used to just wearing it tight now. Definitely cuts off circulation to my freaking forehead.  
Mirrored Mac screen, but it lost connection repeatedly.  Damn. Okay, let‚Äôs try only vision OS to work.  
  
Email is great!  OneNote is great! Calendar, no problem!  Almost there!  
  
MS Teams, shoot!  Microsoft won‚Äôt let me add my account due to some odd org restrictions.  Kind of a deal breaker.  Most of my work is in teams.  Oh, and I screenshot a lot too to help people.  Can‚Äôt do that.  
  
Took it off for most of the work day to take video calls (even if teams worked, I wouldn‚Äôt be using my avatar. Sorry). 
  
Okay, I must take this $4,000 device back. It‚Äôs just not working out. It‚Äôs allllmost there for work, but it‚Äôs kinda heavy, FOV sucks and some of the apps I need just aren‚Äôt there.  
  
Wait‚Ä¶a city near me has a 21W light seal in stock!  Let‚Äôs go swap it!  
  
BAM GAME CHANGING.  FOV Rocks! It‚Äôs no longer heavy. It‚Äôs fairly comfortable.  
  
I drive home, put the kids to sleep, and just spend 3.5 hours in it nonstop, watching that Apple TV+ show in bed, browsing Reddit, playing a few iPad games‚Ä¶then got up to do dishes.  It works! Did a whole load of dishes with my show up, iMessage on the side to make sure my wife doesn‚Äôt need help with the kids.   
  
Then I pinned photos to my wall, played some lofi music and just had a nostalgia trip looking by at my kids growing up. 
  
I spent like 30 minutes just going through photos, our family trips, the panoramas..  
  
I fell in love with this damn device tonight.  The light seal is a legit game changer.  
  
Looking back at the last 4 days. I‚Äôve legit had some truly unique life experiences in this headset.  It‚Äôs so immersive, and personal.  I‚Äôm not sure I can return it now.  The more I use it and get used to the OS, understanding its limitations, using it with intent‚Ä¶it‚Äôs really growing on me super quickly.","The More I Use It, The More I Fall In Love With It",0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1ak5f9t/the_more_i_use_it_the_more_i_fall_in_love_with_it/

LightRockzz,1707047277.0,,1aim6ah,t3_1aim6ah,140,186,"The vision pro is amazing, and Ive had every single Oculus and Meta headset ever made. This is absolutely on another league.

First the nitpiks: 1) the fov is awful, it needs a much wider fov to be fully immersive but thankfully, you only notice when you first put it on and once you get into your apps, you mostly forget about it unless you look. Edit: From reading other posts, its seems that the poor FOV might improve with a different lightseal. My light seal was a 35W which I think is the worst one for FOV.

2) the external camera pass through quality seems quite poor, the real world around you feels dull and washed out when wearing it whereas the environments look stunning and lifelike so the displays arent the issue, the camera feed is. Its  better than the quest 3s cameras but much worse than the environments so probably a technological limitation on how how high quality realtime zero latency video can get.

3) the solo loop band is worthless for longer than 10 mins, the dual loop band is way more comfy and should be the default.

All that said, the nitpicks are not deal breakers and will definitely improve in the gen 2 version. The important thing is that the visual fidelity of the display is life like, watching movies on it is better than the cinema and the ability to mirror your mac and get work done on a gigantic screen is an actual killer app imo. Apple nailed the UI and controls. This is the future and in our lifetime, this tech will absolutely be as ubiquitous as the iphone.

EDIT, 2 more Nitpiks:

1. There needs to be a Movie Mode and also a Bed Mode like another user posted that you can only exit by physically pressing either button above.¬†Movie watching is a killer app but the stupid interface popping on anytime you move your hands is extremely annoying.

2. Please work with the devs to add in support  WebXR and OpenXR/MR and release a DeoVR app. Its a universal standard and its a shame its not supported yet in day one.

Not only does everything feel so real, I can have a Safari window open while oogling hotties on the subway. (Does anyone know how to turn off the external eyes?)

The first time I looked at my hands through the AVP, I was like wow, those are really my hands, on top of a digital interface, with nearly no distortion. Mark Zuckerberg could never, this is the only VR device ever to have this level of immersion.

The motion blur people complain about only feels natural to me, it's like being on Ketamine without failing my 12 step program.

People complain about pixelation and chromatic aberration, but it makes me feel like I'm living in the Matrix. Who doesn't want to live in the Matrix? I'm like Keanu reaves working on Jira in one window and dodging HR bullets watching porn hub in another, because no one will ever know.

I literally don't see any reason why I'd ever take the Apple Vision Pro off my face.

I will probably never go outside or interact with another human being in meatspace because it is simply just not as immersive as strapping $3500 goggles on my face and listening through AirPods Pro (Gen 2, I'm not poor).

> It‚Äôs like a ‚Äúmonster,‚Äù Cook tells me. ‚ÄúAn apparatus.‚Äù Cook‚Äôs told to take a seat, and this massive, monstrous machine is placed around his face. It‚Äôs crude, like a giant box, and it‚Äôs got screens in it, half a dozen of them layered on top of each other, and cameras sticking out like whiskers. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt really wearing it at that time,‚Äù he tells me. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt wearable by any means of the imagination.‚Äù And it‚Äôs whirring, with big fans‚Äîa steady, deep humming sound‚Äîon both sides of his face. And this apparatus has these wires coming out of it that sinuate all over the floor and stretch into another room, where they‚Äôre connected to a supercomputer, and then buttons are pressed and lights go on and the CPU and GPU start pulsating at billions of cycles per second and‚Ä¶Tim Cook is on the moon! 

A lot of people think about technology from Apple with the mindset of Steve Jobs, he just thought it up and pulled it out of his back pocket and voila! But we must always remember a big part of getting here is time, patience and waiting on pieces of the technology to catch up. Eight years ago when this project started was around 2015/2016. Thats not long ago, thats just a year before the iPhone X, Windows 10 was the desktop operating system from Microsoft. 

To go from the described contraption to what will be available tomorrow is nothing more than science fiction come to life. We really have it good, but you have to give kudos to the teams at Apple behind this. Tim Cook could of easily said, I can't see this coming to fruition as what you are dreaming and cancel it right then and there. But the journey and the exploration was invested in. It must be amazing to work for a company that stands behind what feels like the impossible and help you through it. We see pre-emptive approaches from companies like Microsoft (HoloLens) Google (Glass). They get the leaks, they know whats happening at Apple. But stumble along the way to ultimately burn out at the end. At the core of Apple, is the belief in the element of surprise, delight and magic.

- It seems like Apple thinks this will be as big as iPhone launch, but at the same time we don‚Äôt have any event before the preorder, so Apple does not really have anything to show us. More than that they showed it at wwdc. But wwdc is a conference for developers. So they never showed it to consumers. 

- we still don‚Äôt know the specs or pricing (other than base model), just guessing on options and specs. Which makes it impossible to have some time to think which model you would want to get (how much storage, anything else?)

In the system settings, under eye and hand tracking, there is a button called Realign displays.  
  
Turns out you can do this again, of course, by entering this mode, and holding down the digital crown. This brings the displays together until they automatically stop where it thinks your IPD is.  
  
If you press and hold the other button, on your left hand side, you can manually widen the IPD. I pushed this as far as I could, and noticed that the displays didn‚Äôt get any less clear. Weird, I thought. Wasn‚Äôt the point of IPD to make sure the displays stay sharp?  
  
I realigned my displays using the crown, then pressed down the left side button for HALF A SECOND.  
  
I hear the motors, and the displays barely shift.  
  
And then my apps come back. And holy fuck, my eyes felt this sense of relief.  
  
I didn‚Äôt get eye strain before, and I never felt my eyes while using the headset. But when I looked at my windows, my eyes totally relaxed. I didnt know I wanted this. I would have never known. But now I can see the individual pixels of my iPad apps, and my 3D space feels ever so slightly more realistic.  
  
My eyes take less time to adjust from close objects to far objects, and I feel like I was really missing out on a device I was already using for hours.

First off‚Ä¶I cannot stop thinking that I just saw the future. It is so clear to me after using AVP in the Apple Store for 20 minutes that this format is undoubtedly the future. It‚Äôs hard for me to wrap my head around what I just used and saw; and also hard for me to imagine anyone contesting that. 

I had the 21W light seal and my immersion was pretty killer. I‚Äôve never used any other headsets before so maybe my gauge is wrong but the FOV seemed totally fine to me? At no point did I feel unimmersed unless I chose to dial it back and feel that way. 

I didn‚Äôt like the solo band much though to be honest. It was incredibly cool looking and feeling; how the dial spins to fit, etc. I wanted to like it but the dual loop band was just so much more comfortable. My only gripe was honestly just the weight; I definitely felt it the whole time it was on me. It wasn‚Äôt necessarily uncomfortable but I was very aware of the unit on my head. Maybe over time and more constant use (and more constant use of the dual loop band) that would fade a bit, I‚Äôm not sure. If that thing was $2k I would‚Äôve walked out with it right then and there. No questions asked. The video content and Spatial Video memories almost had me in tears. To the point that I would be worried about playing my own memories on it without losing it and crying haha. 

The whole experience was seamless, the OS had a couple of glitches I noticed. Very slight like once in a while I‚Äôd look at something and it would slightly stutter before I could tap it. Could‚Äôve also just been the overuse of the demo unit. Nothing that I wouldn‚Äôt expect from a 1.0 piece of software. At the moment I wish I had my own to play with and engage with. Gosh do I wish that thing was just a littttle more affordable. Just a little bit. Wow. Congrats to everyone that‚Äôs picked one up.

Numerous-Roof-7544,1705242683.0,,196h4d6,t3_196h4d6,73,160,"Apple has prepared its most sophisticated sales pitch ever, including a demo lasting up to 25 minutes ‚Äî longer than it takes to watch your favorite sitcom.

The demo begins with a retail worker scanning the user‚Äôs face with an app ‚Äî in a similar fashion to setting up Face ID. This scan will tell the employee hosting the demo which light seal, foam cushion and band size the customer will need. The light seal, which keeps outside light from leaking in, comes in more than 25 shapes and sizes. The cushions, meanwhile, come in two sizes.

Once the unit is in hand, the employee will explain how the interface works. That includes how to control the pointer using a user‚Äôs eyes, how to gesture to make selections and how to hold the headset. The staffer will also show how to adjust the so-called Fit Dial on the main headband and how to use the Digital Crown for moving between virtual and augmented reality. The employee will have an iPad to view what the user is seeing on the Vision Pro.

The retail employee will allow users to place the device on their own heads. Once the headset is on, customers will need to calibrate the device with various tracking and tapping exercises so it can follow their eyes and hands. That includes looking at circular dot patterns set at different brightness levels and a hand scan in the field of vision of the device.

After all that, the roughly 20- to 25-minute demo can begin:

1. Users will be directed to the photos app to view still images that are similar to the ones preloaded on Apple‚Äôs other devices in retail stores. That‚Äôs followed by examples of panorama shots.
2. Then the demo starts to get more interesting. The customer sees 3D images that Apple calls spatial photos (in this case, of a kid hitting a pi√±ata) and a spatial video (footage of a birthday party).
3. The next part of the demo shows how to use the device as a computer or iPad replacement. It explains how to position multiple app windows in space and scroll through webpages in the Safari browser.
4. Customers are then shown 3D and immersive movies, including clips of wild animals, the ocean and sports. There is also a compelling scene that makes users feel as if they‚Äôre on a tightrope.

ChicagoBoy2011,1708182492.0,,1at41q4,t3_1at41q4,91,153,"Yesterday, I had a 3hr flight to take. Downloaded a couple movies on Disney+. on AppleTV, and a couple episodes of shows, just because I wasn't sure what I'd be in the mood for when the flight came.  Someone else here mentioned that they got grief from a FA for having it on as soon as they sat down, so I wanted until we were JUST about to take off to put it on.

For context, I had to book this flight kind of late, and got a middle seat way in the back. Not comfortable. But I honestly am not exaggerating how wearing it COMPLETELY transformed that experience for me. Like, it was almost religious.. it truly felt liberating. Whereas before it would've been cramped, and annoying, and I'd be holding my phone at a weird angle trying to watching something... it GENUINELY felt no different than if I were watching a movie in the theater. The first time I started to turn the slider, and the seat in front of me slowly became a tranquil nature scene... I dunno, it just really tricks your brain into ACTUALLY perceiving that greater sense of space.

Another thing which it made me appreciate so much where some of Apple's design choices. When the promo was released and they highlighted the mechanic of using the crown to dial the immersion, I remember thinking just how unbelievably stupid that was -- like, ""Why would I ever want to be doing that, and doing it so much that it's the primary button on the device?! LULZ APPLE DUMB"" Whelp, I can say wholeheartedly how big of a 180 I've done on that perspective. The fact that that mechanic DOES exist made it so much more useful for wearing it in the real world. I could easily keep wearing it and see the flight attendant when they came around for drinks, for instance, or take a look at the inflight tracking and then quickly go back to my movie.

I can't quite accurately convey how quick and painless this made the flight appear. For this use-case ALONE  I think this is already an extremely compelling product. I truly do wish they work on making it even more comfortable, because as far as I'm concerned the only knock on this whole thing is that you do feel the device on your face after a while.

P.S.: I did get attitude from the FA that I had to take if off for landing, which honestly makes 0 sense but I didn't feel like fighting that battle so happily complied. I mean, if I were wearing a sleep mask, out cold, surely I wouldn't have been woken up, right? And phones/iPads were being used all around me, and I even had the non-immersive environment set, so he could just talk to me.  


P.P.S: Some folks are raising good and convincing points about why having the device on during takeoff/landing may be unadvisable; curious to see whether airlines will (or maybe have?) set policies in place for this.",Reflections on a 3hr flight: Holy Shit,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1at41q4/reflections_on_a_3hr_flight_holy_shit/

So everyone loves Environments but there just aren't enough of them.  We're close to launching our AVP app that has 50+ new Environments with the below features.  Does this sound interesting to you guys and would any of you be willing to beta test this with us?  Our plan is to launch this at $4.99 for the 50+ environments and if people like it, we'll constantly add more environments.

&#x200B;

**Features:**

* 50+ stunning Environments in full immersion 360 degrees
* Immersive and captivating sound design that makes you feel like you are actually there
* Some particle effects such as fog, clouds, light-snow etc to add to the realism
* The environments have a relaxing and meditative feel

&#x200B;

Would love to hear ideas/comments

EDIT: Several people asked so yes these are high-res 360 degree HDR images (around 12k x 6k pixels per image).  We add effects and matching  sounds to each environment to add to the immersion.

YMMV depending on the throughput of your home network situation, but I have a pretty standard router that was several rooms away, and this was the result. In [this first video](https://youtu.be/NKu5KMigrbc) that I made this morning, you'll see me just demonstrating playing RoR2 without latency. If you think I'm doing poorly at the game due to latency, I'm not. I'm doing poorly at the game because I'm poor at the game.

[In this second video](https://youtu.be/jGeuknDqQrE), I turned on a monitor for my PC and set the AVP Moonlight window next to it to scroll through games so you can see side by side the actual PC screen and the AVP client in real time. See any latency? Neither did I.

I just hammered this out....I apologize in advance if there are errors. 

&#x200B;

Get Moonlight (Vision Pro beta version) on your Vision Pro

1. Download Testflight from the app store on your vision pro

2. Go to [https://testflight.apple.com/join/4eE59dyH](https://testflight.apple.com/join/4eE59dyH) to add the Moonlight vision pro beta to your device

&#x200B;

Get Sunshine on your PC

1. Go to [https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/releases/tag/v0.21.0](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/releases/tag/v0.21.0)

2. Download ""sunshine-windows-installer.exe"" by left clicking or right click/save as

3. Run Sunshine

4. I did not do much if anything to Sunshine other than make a username and password. For more help/info watch this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKruAYPR3sk&t=222s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKruAYPR3sk&t=222s)

5. Sunshine should be running in your system tray of your task bar. You can double click to open the web ui sunshine interface. 

&#x200B;

Get your computer's IP address

1. Windows Settings / Network & Internet / Advanced network settings / Hardware and connection properties

2. Note the value in IPv4 default gateway

&#x200B;

Configure Moonlight

1. Open Sunshine web ui

2. Click on Pin in the top left, leave this page open

3. Open Moonlight on VP

4. Click the + to the right of Computers in the top left of the app

5. Enter the IP address

6. You will be prompted with a pin, enter this pin into the Sunshine web ui page

7. That should connect Sunshine on your PC to Moonlight on your VP.  Note: Sometimes I had to do this a few times for it to connect. 

8. You should see an icon with your computer name under ""Computers"" in Moonlight now. 

9. If you click on ""Desktop"" in Moonlight it will open and mirror your main display 

10. If you click ""Steam Big Picture"" it will open and mirror Steam Big Picture (still occurring on your main real display)

11. Note: You can open Desktop, use your hand to pinch/hold then move around the mouse, click on steam and open whatever you want. Can also open Xbox/Epic/literally anything. I do not know how to right click. A single finger touch appears to always be a left click. 

12. On the left side of Moonlight there is a gear icon. Click that.

13. If you click resolution you will see multiple preset options. You can also select custom resolutions for your Moonlight stream window by changing the values on the bottom manually. You are best off selecting the exact resolution as your real monitor - OR ELSE you will get black bars. 

14. Set your framerate at 90 

15. Bitrate will be something you play with later depending on your network stability. I do not remember what the default speed was. 

16. I turned off onscreen controls

17. Supposedly the H.264 codec looks the best but doesn't work at higher resolutions than 4096 x 2160. It's probably best to leave it on auto when you are just starting. 

18. Enable HDR (if you want it)

19. I clicked smoothest video on (but I have not played with on/off testing of this yet). My latency seems good as it. 

20. Statistics overlay can show you if you have dropped frames/latency, good for testing

&#x200B;

Virtual Monitor Setup

1. Link to GitHub [https://github.com/itsmikethetech/Virtual-Display-Driver?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/itsmikethetech/Virtual-Display-Driver?tab=readme-ov-file)

2. Download Windows 11 22H2+ HDR (or the other one if you have Windows 10)

3. In that Download you will find a folder called ""IddSampleDriver""

4. Copy that folder as is over to your root C: drive

5. Open option.txt

6. Make sure that the resolutions that you want for your virtual monitor are written on a separate line (ex. 5120, 2160, 90). The 90 is the framerate that will be selectable in the windows display settings.

7. Make sure you edit and save the options.txt document BEFORE installing the virtual driver. 

8. Follow the youtube video here exactly for driver installation instructions. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=byfBWDnToYk&t=190s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=byfBWDnToYk&t=190s)

9. At this point you should have a virtual monitor as a 2nd screen.

&#x200B;

Assign Sunshine to use your virtual monitor instead of your primary screen

1. Type cd in the windows search bar then press enter to open command prompt

2. Navigate to C:\\Program Files\\Sunshine\\tools

3. Drag dxgi-info into the command prompt box, press enter

4. Find the name for your virtual monitor by recognizing the resolution. Mine says \\\\.\\DISPLAY6

5. Note: I do not know if this naming is static... I hope it is. I suspect it could go up in number if you add and remove the virtual driver over and over like I have done lol. 

6. Copy this name into your sunshine web ui / configuration / Audio/video page at the bottom. (mine is ""\\\\.\\DISPLAY6"")

***EDIT it‚Äôs not static. I restarted and mine is display 5 now. I first noticed because something was wrong because Sunshine said it couldn‚Äôt find a working encoder. Annoying. 

7. Click save and apply. 

8. Next time you open sunshine ""Desktop"" it will open your virtual display. 

9. If colors look crazy, turn off and back on HDR, should fix it. Happens sometimes to me. 

&#x200B;

I hope this helps someone! Cheers

I don't think this behavior is very mature considering people are using this sub to promote their apps, and if your app seems overpriced, you should be able to handle the criticism. There are a lot of comments in this thread that are criticizing the 13 dollar price point as well, so I wonder if they were all blocked too.

1FrostySlime,1707241516.0,,1akfn1j,t3_1akfn1j,147,138,"I‚Äôve been using Juno since I got my AVP but I think today I‚Äôm going to have to stop using it. There‚Äôs just way way way too many bugs. 

For people who don‚Äôt know Juno is made by the same person who developed apollo as a youtube app for the AVP since Youtube very kindly decided to blacklist their app from the app store. At first I was quite excited for it, it was literally the first app I bought and downloaded onto the device, but after using it for ten or so hours over the past couple days I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in a usable state right now. 

Let‚Äôs go over some of my issues with it

1. Watch history doesn‚Äôt sync between the AVP and other devices or vice versa. Clicking a video that has a progess bar because it was watched on another device yields the video starting from the beginning. Videos watched on AVP don‚Äôt even appear in my watch history let alone synced across other devices. 

2. Clicking on the home tab will frequently result in a signed out default home page. Clicking the sign in button isn‚Äôt hard but it‚Äôs extremely weird that I have to do it all. 

3. I will frequently find that I will ‚Äúaccedentilly‚Äù (I don‚Äôt even know how I‚Äôm doing this) skip to some random point in the video, completely runining the experience. 

4. I have found that sometimes, instead of it opening a Juno page, it will just open a youtube webpage in the Juno app, I actually prefer this because the webpage is far more usable but this is more annoying since it isn‚Äôt remotely consistent. 

5. One of the MAIN FEATURES I hope would be possible, downloading videos, doesn‚Äôt appear to be possible right now. Clicking on the dots that would normally yield a download button just plays the video. 

6. Speeding up or slowing down the video causes the video to buffer slightly and clicking the buttons before the video loads tells you that the video has been sped up but actually does nothing. 

7. Many many MANY features are missing completely. Likes/Dislikes, Comments, Autoplay, Recommended videos in the side pannel, clicking the end cards at the end of the video, and probably more I can‚Äôt think of right now or haven‚Äôt encountered yet. 

I hope these issues are fixed but what was the point of even releasing the app in this state. Many of these issues are ones I noticed within 3 seconds of opening the app that I refuse to believe the developer didn‚Äôt notice and yet he felt the app was in a state to not only release it but charge for it. This app feels (probably because as far as I can tell it was) rushed out the door as fast as possible to make sure it was up and making money before the headset released. He said that he charges for it because we should get used to pay for apps so people have an incentive to develop them for the AVP but this app is not something I felt was remotely worth my money when a 2x better experince exists in the browser.",Juno is kinda garbage,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1akfn1j/juno_is_kinda_garbage/

patterson180,1706925524.0,,1ahkqif,t3_1ahkqif,27,124,"In case anyone is interested, I‚Äôll give my impressions after several hours inside the AVP. I‚Äôm not super techy or an Apple fanboy (though I own a lot of apple products) but am very interested in VR/AR. I bought the original Oculus Quest about 4 years ago and absolutely was blown away by VR, I used it a ton for about 6 months and then have just used it occasionally since, mainly because the top thing I want in VR is to get lost in experiences (movies, ‚Äútraveling/exploring‚Äù, sporting events, concerts, etc.), and the resolution on the Oculus just didn‚Äôt allow that imo. I decided I‚Äôd wait until a company came out with a high def headset I‚Äôd buy it, so when Apple announced this I was stoked.

Today I got it delivered to my house, I thought it would be a HUGE jump - a 2019 Oculus Quest to a 2024 Apple Vision Pro! Well, it was and it wasn‚Äôt, here are my impressions:

* UI/Ecosystem: The eye tracking and navigation with your hands/fingers is amazing and just an incredible experience in itself.
* First thing I looked at was the panoramas I‚Äôd taken in the past (really wish I would have taken more now!), it was cool to be ‚Äúback where I was when I took the photo‚Äù.
* FOV: There are black borders, more intrusive than I was expecting, which was disappointing. However, it isn‚Äôt like ‚Äúbinoculars‚Äù and after using it for a bit I didn‚Äôt even notice them. But they are there.
* Passthrough: I wasn‚Äôt too concerned about passthrough as I‚Äôm more interested in immersive experiences, but the reviews kept saying how it was by far the best passthrough, and I‚Äôm sure it is the best but this was still a disappointment. It‚Äôs very good. But it is still a video of your surroundings. 
* VR: This will be the top feature eventually I would guess, and I‚Äôm surprised Apple didn‚Äôt have more of this at launch. The ones they had were pretty good and fun to watch. The close ups during them are amazing. But why are the landscapes/backgrounds still blurry in these?
* AR: They were pretty good, not perfect. The shadows in relation to the depth/objects are the most incredible thing. You can see shadows on the floor and on the wall, hard to describe until you see it.
* Sound: Wasn‚Äôt planning to really think about the sound, but it is incredible with the built in speakers. I bought the 2nd gen AirPods pro but not sure they‚Äôre needed.
* Comfort/fit: When unboxing my first thought was ‚Äúoh it IS pretty heavy‚Äù, but wearing it wasn‚Äôt bad. It isn‚Äôt light but it isn‚Äôt ridiculously heavy.
* Movies 3D: I have slow internet so I downloaded instead of streaming. It took a while. It is very good after downloading, not perfectly smooth, but the best 3D experience I‚Äôve had.
* Spatial video: Take as many of these as you can. I took one, my first one (just from the AVP as I don‚Äôt have the most current iPhone), of my wife and cat and rewatched it back. You can reach your hand out and touch the person‚Äôs hand or pet the cat and it is incredible to watch back. These will be memories that can live forever, I wish I had some of my two cats and my family members that died!
* Personas: I don‚Äôt really care about this because I don‚Äôt plan to use it, but I was pretty blown away by how well it was done.

Other random thoughts:

* It seems very breakable! I didn‚Äôt get Apple Care and first I picked it up wrong and it fell onto my couch, then when I was done with my first session I forgot the battery was in my pocket and almost tugged it onto the floor. I have Apple Care now‚Ä¶
* I feel like the people that are describing it as OUT OF THIS WORLD and MIND BLOWING have never used a VR headset before or are over-hyping it. But it is super cool.

Is it worth 3500+? Probably not right now, but I‚Äôm keeping mine. Craziest thing is that in 10 years we‚Äôll look back at this thing as ancient like the original iPod or iPhone or how websites used to look. Which is insane because right now it feels like I‚Äôm living in the future with this thing :)",Impressions after Day 1 from a not super techy person,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1ahkqif/impressions_after_day_1_from_a_not_super_techy/
NlilNJA,1706809389.0,,1aggsb4,t3_1aggsb4,182,128,"With just under 24 hours until the Apple Vision Pro is released in U.S Apple stores, I would like to remind everyone to NOT come earlier than their designated pick-up time window. 

Apple stores, at least for launch day, will be VERY strict and will uphold the integrity of the time windows primarily because it is a very extensive process. If you come earlier than your pick-up time window, I can confidently say they will kindly request you to come back at your designated pick-up time window.

**‚ÄúBut the time window says it‚Äôs *ready for pick-up*, why can‚Äôt I just pick it up‚Äù?**

Just because the app says it‚Äôs ‚Äúready for pick-up‚Äù, doesn‚Äôt mean there is an available Apple employee who can deliver the product to you and provide the best experience possible. Each hour, there are a certain amount of pick-ups that is expected, if customers start coming earlier, it can throw off the wait times for the customers who actually have that same pick-up window.

It saying your Apple Vision Pro is ready-for pickup is largely because it is officially in the store and tagged with your name. It has no correlation of how busy or not it is in that given hour. I get it, it can be rather mis-leading, but for this specific launch and the whole process involved, everything has to be time based.

**Pick-up process in three phases:**

During the pick-up process, customers will indeed have the opportunity to confirm their fit. During that process, a demo device will be handed to you to make sure the sizings are correct and adjust if needed. 

The Apple Vision Pro will be kitted to your specifications, sealed and then delivered to you. As you can probably envision, this will likely take more than 5-10 minutes for that process alone. Please be patient.

Then, customers will have the opportunity to receive a strictly curated 20-minute demo, from a demo device to get started and the how-to‚Äôs. (That is why the windows are 30-minute slots). Again, a specific demo device will be used for this, not yours. 

There will also likely be a set-up table where you can presumably unbox and set up the Apple Vision Pro, if you so wish to do so at your own leisure. This will largely be self-guided since Apple specialists cannot guide you in ways they can with any other Apple product.

**To re-cap;**

- At least for launch day, please do NOT try to come earlier or you‚Äôll be kindly asked to come back at your pick-up time window. BUT if you do, feel free to come into the store to explore and see the Apple Vision Pro. It‚Äôll likely be a very busy, but overall fun day.

- There will be plenty of opportunities to ensure you get the right fit in store, even before you open your own Apple Vision Pro. I know a lot of people will prefer to unbox at home.

- If you miss your pick-up time window, that is fine. You just won‚Äôt have the option for a 20-minute curated demo, and if you do want one, you‚Äôll just have to be put in a queue wait list, based on demand.

- Pick-up process will be extensive but the stores should be all hands on deck to make it as seamless as possible. Expect to be there roughly 30-40 minutes if you‚Äôd like the entire experience. If it‚Äôs so busy and Apple Stores are running behind, leaking into your pick-up window, don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll still have an option of that demo.

Exciting times ya‚Äôll, but please be kind to Apple employees, especially on launch day. It‚Äôs a new product, worked very hard on a game plan and also learning together at the same time. Expect lines of course but enjoy the historical launch day experience!",PSA: Please stick to your scheduled pick-up time window.

The Vision Pro is the greatest leap in technology since the original iPhones and I can‚Äôt wait to see how great the spatial videos will look. If we keep stigmatizing how ‚Äúisolated‚Äù individuals will be using the Vision Pro, we will never see this technology reach full potential. Knowing Apple, the Vision Pro will shrink in size and have better form-factor in 10 years. Most ground-breaking new generation technology looks goofy in its first iterations. Hopefully in ten years when the technology is more developed and streamlined, casually having these on wouldn‚Äôt turn as much heads.

Basically, yeah it‚Äôs a bit goofy looking right now, but as we acclimate to the technology maybe we can all relive birthday parties in 3D spatial video in the same way we‚Äôd watch home VHS tapes.

blabus,1707116595.0,,1ajajmi,t3_1ajajmi,102,118,"I haven't yet come across this comparison so figured I'd post my thoughts for anyone who's interested. For full context, I built a dedicated home theater in my house at a total cost of about $60,000 (equipment and materials, labor was done myself). For any AV nerds, here is the full system:

* 150"" diagonal 2.40:1 Seymour screen
* JVC NZ7 true 4K (8K pixel-shift) projector
* Dual JL Audio Fathom 13.5"" in-wall subwoofers (1000W each)
* JBL Synthesis in-wall speakers in 7.2.4 Atmos configuration
* VTV 500W monoblock amplifiers (1 per channel, 11 total)
* Lyngdorf MP-60 2.1 AV processor
* MadVR Envy Extreme MkII video processor
* Kaleidescape movie server

Here are some of my thoughts on how the Vision Pro compares:


**Video**

Overall, picture quality on the Vision Pro is excellent. It doesn't quite manage to match the sharpness of my projector, but I'd say it's 90% of the way there. Brightness seems to be on par with my projector + screen (I actually expected the Vision Pro to beat my projector in this regard but they're very close). Contrast, color and dynamic range on the Vision Pro are all similarly within spitting distance of the projector. My projector does not support 3D playback but even if it did, I'm fairly certain the Vision Pro offers a drastically better 3D quality than any other viewing option (up to and including commercial movie theaters). Another issue common to home theaters that is solved effortlessly by the Vision Pro is varying aspect ratios. I specifically chose an anamorphic aspect ratio for my screen so that it matches the majority of Hollywood movies shot in that format, but when I watch something in a different ratio (such as the ~16:9 ratio of nearly all TV shows) I have black bars on the left and right of the screen (similar to how there are typically black bars on the top and bottom of TVs when viewing most movies). Fun fact: the MadVR Envy video processor listed above is a _$16,000_ device that exists largely to solve just this issue (scaling different aspect ratios to fit a fixed screen size/shape in real-time).

The only drawback I've found to viewing movies on the Vision Pro is the inconsistent maximum screen size and available environments across different apps. Apple really should expose their controls and environments (including the fantastic generic movie theater) as an option for any and all video playback across the system, rather than limited to content originating from the Apple TV app. As it stands, it's a similar annoyance to certain Apple TV apps rolling their own video playback UI rather than just using Apple's default interface.

Also, a caveat on video quality: I use a service called Kaleidescape to watch movies in the home theater. It's essentially Tidal but for movies, wherein they have relationships with all of the studios to offer the original uncompressed source files that are the same files they burn to the Blu-rays. These are noticeably higher quality than the same movie accessed over any other service (including purchased iTunes movies), in both video and audio quality. I'd love for Kaleidescape to build an app for the Vision Pro but I'm not holding my breath. All of that is to say, my home theater has a bit of an unfair advantage with access to the highest quality versions of movies available anywhere (outside of physical Blu-ray discs).


**Audio**

This is where the Vision Pro (understandably) has difficulty competing with a higher end dedicated setup. The spatial audio mapping is very good and surround sound is decent, but of course it cannot reproduce the same level of directional sound as 11 physical speakers surrounding the viewer's head (particularly the Atmos channels handled by the in-ceiling speakers). The much bigger drawback to me, however, is the overall power, particularly the low end. At the volume I use my home theater at, the subwoofers are felt more than they're heard, and for certain genres such as action there's just no pair of headphones that can remotely come close to replicating that experience. Personally I find audio to be far more important to feeling immersed in a film than video, but of course that's just my opinion.


**Viewing Experience**

This is obvious, but currently the Vision Pro cannot provide a proper social movie viewing experience for multiple people. While I haven't been able to try SharePlay, I imagine that it's still not the same as being able to look to my left or right and see the people watching the movie next to me, hear their reactions to it, talk to them, etc. Even if everyone I knew had a Vision Pro, I don't think I would invite a group of friends over just for all of us to don AR headsets the way I would invite a group of friends to watch a movie in our theater. Having said that, the social isolation aspect seems like a fully solvable problem (even going as far as eventually being able to track full human bodies so that you can see others sitting next to you in the same virtual theater environment). One benefit of a shared experience through VR is that everyone theoretically has the perfect seat in the house, whereas my home theater offers the best possible audio experience in the center seat.


**Overall**

A lot of people have been asking me if I would still build the home theater today. I would say yes, for the audio and shared viewing experience. I believe the latter can and will be solved, but I'm less confident of headphone makers figuring out how to overcome physics anytime soon. The video quality, however, is absolutely astonishing on the Vision Pro. It takes a $10,000+ projector to beat it, and not by much at that (ignoring of course that ~nobody can place anything close to a 100 ft screen in their home theater). And of course, I'm extremely fortunate to have the luxury of a home theater at all; I would say the Vision Pro absolutely decimates the average home living room AV setup, and beyond that, it's incredibly impressive (and a bit scary) how much money I had to spend to beat it.

Happy to answer any other questions if anyone has any.

First, open windows do not hold their arrangement when switching to a guest user.  I don't think there's any rhyme or reason to how they move and it seems completely random where they will be when the guest user completes their calibration.  It's a terrible way to start a demo, having the user go fetch windows from the floor or ceiling.
   
Second, screen mirroring is helpful but doesn't work for videos?  If a guest starts an immersive video on Apple TV+ the headset (and the screen mirror) go black.  This is either a bug or a ""feature"" of the anti-streaming copy protection.    
    
Finally, guest users want to *experience* what the device does, not learn how to *use* it.  Give guests an app that's basically on auto-pilot, show-casing an immersive picture, video and movie, then switch between a few of the environments and whatever else you want to throw in...

Flying from Ft Lauderdale to San Francisco. About a 6 hour flight.

I was hesitant at first because I didn't want to look out of place so I didn't wear it.

About halfway flight, I put it on. 

It immediately recognized I was in motion and it suggested travel mode for me.

I put on travel mode and everything worked as it should. There was minimal tracking issues. Things littered for a few seconds then stabilized.

I put on masters of air on apple plus and put it in cinema mode. It was amazing and extremely stable. I had no issues watching it. With my airpods, i was completely immersed... we flew through some turbulence and watching that movie I felt like I was in the plane with them while shaking in the plane.

I then joined the wifi on board and opened up a page and tracked my flight on flight aware and had the movie to the right.

The headrest display of the plane was a little bright so I turned up the immersion mode (not sure what it's called) and it canceled out the center for me so it was no longer an issue.

I'm at a loss of words. Everything worked beautifully. I could type, watch flight status, watch a movie, tune out my environment just to the point where I saw around me... and I'm on the window seat so I could open the shade look outside. Close it and get back to my movie. 

Only weird hiccup was thr eye tracking qas little off. I had to look slightly right of qhat i was aiming for it to track my eye.

I got a screen grab of me using it which I'll share when I land on YouTube. 

Ask any questions you got. I know not alot of people have flown with it.

If I didn't say it, let me say it again. This is life changing and out of this world. Apple is onto something here.

Think about how work offices will be designed around augmented computing moving forward. The traditional desk setup and office space is at an end. 

&#x200B;

Tim Cook and the brilliant minds at Apple know exactly what this means and what is to come. Think big here and prepare to embrace the massive changes that will come along with this technology. It‚Äôs only the beginning, and I am bought in this time (completely overlooked the value and underestimated impact the iPhone would have on our lives for about 2 years after its release).

Full transparency, I used to work at Apple. I left Apple around September of last year, and my biggest regret was, at the time, not staying until the Vision Pro launch. I did the demo first thing at 8 AM this morning and picked up my vision, pro immediately afterwards, brought it home, and have worn it all day since and it is now about 12 hours later. I was prepared to be disappointed because of the Verge‚Äôs review and other sites.

- We don't know if there will be more than 256gb offered. Some believe there will only be 255gb to start and some others think there will be more because Apple stated ""starting at 3,499""


- It is not known how the prescription insert process will work. We don't know if you need a valid dated prescription that needs to be uploaded and then verified or if it's just typing in your prescription details. We do know that they can only be purchased online and not in store, though store pickup isn't known yet. There are also no details for those that require special lenses for extreme eyesight issues. Lastly, we don't know how long this process will take on launch date. It's possible that taking the time to type in your prescription details will lead to you getting your shipping date pushed back, if this thing really sells fast in limited quantities. There is still the possibility Apple will open up adding your prescription info and saving it before the actual preorder date. 


- We don't know if you can buy a separate battery, at least on launch. We also don't know the cost or if they will have higher capacity batteries available at any point. We don't know if swapping batteries mid session means your headset completely turns off or if there is a very small reserve battery inside the headset that can power things on standby while you swap. 


- We don't know if more cushions/seals are offered if you buy in store vs online. We don't even know how many seals are available to choose from or what the fitting process looks like. It's not known if there is a more intensive fitting process in store vs online or if it's all sort of the same. It's possible there will be a face scan you can do with your phone that can help you pick the proper size. 


- We don't know how fast the shipping dates will start moving back. We also don't know how many they'll have in store. I do think they'll have more than a few in each store, but I wouldn't expect a whole lot more than that. 


- We don't know of any first party accessories for sale yet that are not included, like stands, etc. 


- We don't know or can't fully advise those of you not in the US what to do or how to buy this with 100 percent confidence on launch. Outside of flying to the US and hoping you can get one on launch date, there isn't much advice to give. 


- We don't know if you can wear a hat comfortably while using it yet. 



- Though we don't know officially how many accounts you can have on one AVP, it seems all signs point to a single user and a single guest account per headset. 


- We don't know when it's launching in Europe yet or anywhere outside of the US. There are only guesses and rumors so far. 


- We don't know of any other event leading up to the release, but we do expect some select YouTubers to have hands on impression/reviews before launch. These videos can possibly help answer a lot of unknowns listed here.","A list of things we don't know, so you can stop asking",0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/193de7e/a_list_of_things_we_dont_know_so_you_can_stop/

As someone who enjoys watching a lot of sport, I have no doubt that this is the definitive way to do so.

But my real use case was for work (full-time remote worker). I have been moving around and traveling a lot in recent years, so was keen to see if this could substitute for my lack of proper work set up. And it can. 

By no means is it perfect, at times the lack of FOV (or feeling that I'm wearing ski goggles) becomes extremely noticeable, the weight and feeling that comes with literally having a small box strapped to my face becomes noticable, but I can't go back. For me, using my eyes and pinching my fingers has felt instantly natural. I can zoom about different windows and applications at incredible speed not possible with a mouse. Being in a private space means I can also easily make use of voice commands. It's just wow. Looking at my 16"" Mac laptop when I'm out of virtual display and put the APV away, it feels like I'm looking at an obsolete device.

There were many titles that were big for the 3D format that are not available yet but I imagine are coming soon, such as Life of Pi, The Walk, Titanic, The Polar Express, and many more Disney/Pixar titles that had disc releases. Everything on Disney+ was also available to purchase on Apple, so hopefully Disney will upgrade many more as time goes on.

Anyone find titles that aren't on the list?

Update 2/8: Dredd (2012) has been added. I remember checking this title specifically earlier in the week and it was not yet 3D, so Apple is actively adding more titles right now.

Around the main race window I had timings, circuit overview, and three on-board cameras that I swapped between drivers based on what was happening on the track.

I watched a few hours after the race and the app kept all the views synced perfectly when pausing/skipping.

2. The working experience is incredible. instead of looking down at my laptop with neck strain, I have it cast right in front of my face with a screen 10 feet wide.
3. The ability to toggle the immersive modes of mount hood or seeing your surroundings is really nice. It's hard to even explain, but I really did feel like I was immersed somewhere else instead of in transit throughout the flight, which I think is the ultimate goal.

EDIT: some important additional clarifications

-You do NOT need to have either device connected to plane wifi to use your AVP as a monitor. It does not run via the wifi on the plane and works without paying for wifi or connecting to plane wifi. You want to connect your macbook to the wifi if you want to use it, and leave your AVP offline. 

-Set up the ""travel mode"" before you take off. I boarded, popped on the AVP, turned on the travel mode, then took it back off until 10k feet. I have read others having issues with turbulence or movement and while I have a sample size of 1, doing this prior to take off made it so I had 0 issues the whole time including removing and putting the device back on several times.

I had the Google Daydream eons ago (fun to play with, horrid image quality), and my only real use case was to be able to lie down and watch movies on a big (crappy) screen.

This idea has been pervasive for a really long time.  Look at some of the first commercials for plasma screen (RIP) TVs and you'll see this use case being shown (better hope your mounting hardware is good!): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqmFYNZ4tYI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqmFYNZ4tYI)

When I try this on the AVP it's mostly a pleasant experience...mostly.

The issue is that the AVP really wants to see your hands at all times and can get fussy when it can't.  So if you pull the covers up to your chin or take a deep breath...it obscures the view of your digits, throws up an error, and takes you out of your Yosemite starfield bliss.  A similar thing happens if you're lying on a couch and turn your head to look a the back rest, a warning comes up saying you're too close to an object.

I'm kind of surprised Apple didn't test for these use cases.  But, form the marketing material, maybe they just thought everyone would always be standing or sitting down?

And even the biggest complaints I heard from popular reviews was that it was ""not perfect"" and ""not like real life"". Those complaints told me Apple knocked this one out of the park, especially for a first model.

Some of the real issues it has I'm actually ok with.

Small FOV? There's gonna be a third party light seal that improves that.

God forbid you eat a bowl of popcorn while watching a movie. Every time you grab one, something gets clicked on the screen. But Apple can fix that with a feature that temporarily disables clicking by saying ""Siri, I'm eating"" then ""Siri, I'm done eating"".

But the glare really bugs me and I don't know how it gets fixed. I was watching the earth video on the IMAX app (try it if you haven't already, it's really good), and I got these cloudy glares right in the middle of the picture that just stayed there. Watching any movie in a dark space will have some sort of distracting glare.

RevolutionaryPeak770,1706964834.0,,1ahvgth,t3_1ahvgth,151,88,"Here's my review of the Vision Pro (and why I'll be returning it) from a pretty average person's perspective. I want to add the caveat at the outset that this thing is totally magical. I loved the demo at the store and bought one on the spot. However, one of the reviews was right: it's magical until it's not anymore. As a note, I'm a super average user: mostly research and writing (legal field) with some video. This device has HUGE promise, but it'll take some time to iron things out. I'm going to try to focus on practical elements because I so wanted this thing to replace my computer. Also, I recognize that this is just day two and this device will make huge strides. However, those strides will come in spurts over the next two to three years, and won't be available any time soon.

Quick rundown of my notes:

* Loved the out of box functionality and feel. Everything is incredibly well thought-out (up to a point).
* Super cool environments.
* App functionality is limited.
* Not as many use cases. The internet is still designed for traditional computers (but this will likely change over time!).
* Heavy. So heavy.
* Passthrough complaints are overstated. I thought it was good!
* Good luck working at a desk and drinking coffee/tea with this thing on.

So I started using this thing yesterday after I picked it up, and the unboxing was fantastic as always. Eye tracking is super smooth, and it recreated the feeling of trying something truly ""futuristic"" for the first time. However, as I began to use it more, it's begun feeling more like a new screen that's just heavy and impedes interacting with my dog and fianc√©e. I do legal research and a lot of writing for a living, so I partially knew this may not work for me. I started by pairing it to my Mac for the screen sharing (Mac Virtual Display) and was immediately met by the seemingly standard Apple technical decisions: you can't... pair your AirPods with the Mac? The virtual display won't play audio from the Mac at all in fact? It's one of those dumb little quirks that will get ironed out, I'm sure, but when I anticipate so many will be using the virtual display, it's not great. I do like that I can blow up my screen to be huge, but also only being able to only have one instance of your Mac at a time rather than multiple windows is really disappointing too. I had hoped I'd be able to run two instances side-by-side to give me unlimited monitor space, but that's likely for future generations. However, my workaround has been to have a Safari instance open alongside the virtual display, as well as Apple Music. It still feels kind of bad that I can't just natively use YouTube in my Mac's instance, but that can be sort of remedied by the Safari workaround for now (didn't bother to pay for Juno).

Also, minor frustration that can easily be worked out (and likely will be soon): I can't pair my MX Master mouse? Passthrough with my keyboard works perfectly, but there's no mouse functionality and the Vision Pro says my mouse isn't supported. That kind of sucked for navigating things easily outside of virtual display.

The actual functionality of VisionOS is pretty much perfect. I love its feel, and it's super responsive. I'm also certain that it'll improve immensely over time, adding cool new features we didn't know we wanted/needed. It will also hopefully influence the way we use the internet‚Äîthe current internet architecture is for phones, but spatial computing is so cool. But for now, opening up Reddit on this thing is just like being on my laptop or phone. I guess one minor concern is that this is a walled garden machine with a lot of DRM capabilities, and part of me laments that the open-ended nature of the laptop might go away if this thing takes off.

For actual work, it's cool. I like that I can be sitting at Mt. Hood and writing, and that you can adjust your environment's wraparound so you can still see things like your door. However, it's still a little strange to me to feel, in a way, blinded and deafened (if I'm wearing my AirPods). Not as much of an issue because you can always use the admittedly very good speakers built into the headset and there's the passthrough functionality, but it's still a little unsettling to someone who has a dog. I can't really see him and I guess I didn't expect to but it's weird to not interact with him as much as I would if I was sitting at a computer. I get why some reviewers have said it feels a little more lonely in here. If I was single and didn't have a pet, this would probably be more ""useful"" if that makes sense. I've been able to work well on this device, but it all more or less happens within an instance of my Mac, which makes this feel a little like an extra step. A lot of people might end up feeling like this is an iPad analogue rather than a regular computer: it's very much ALMOST there, but may just end up becoming a more niche device that people can't fully use for work but like to use for some work purposes.

As I've been working, the novelty has been fading more, which is good! I think the novelty is a huge selling point, which I certainly appreciate. However, at the end of the day, it's an eye computer. I like that I can watch sports on a big screen, but I also like to watch sports socially, so this is a little weird. However, if they end up adding functionality where I can get a seat at a stadium for a soccer or football game and feel like I'm there, that would be so awesome. I would use this thing almost solely for that if I could, but again, it makes more sense for people who are alone‚ÄîI'm a social sports watcher and not having someone else be able to see what I'm seeing and react to that with me would leave me feeling like something is missing. For TV/movies, that's certainly the number one use case, but again, because it's strapped to your eyes, it's a necessarily solo experience. I'm sure some will roll their eyes and say ""what did you expect? It's an AR/VR headset."" And they'd be correct, but that also limits some of its use cases to being highly individualized necessarily. The magic of this thing is definitely in immersive experiences, and they're something I'm excited for, but only in small doses. I don't really want to ""live"" in this thing‚ÄîI want to use it every so often for a movie when my fianc√©e is watching TV or I'm lounging around with some downtime and I'm not socializing. It's a really cool unplugging type of device, but one for limited time quantities.

This is also due to the weight. I'm sure my neck muscles would get stronger over time, but I can't let this thing sit on my head for more than 45 minutes. I wrote this review while in the Vision Pro, and already I'm feeling the neck strain. I'm wearing the dual loop strap, and it's fantastic, but even that can't save me from the weight fatigue. Using this thing on a long-haul flight (as I had originally intended) might be okay give the back and head rests, but absent that, it's a little tough.

I don't care about the personas stuff but the debate is also pointless to me: it's an eye computer that's approximating your entire face. It'll improve in time, but even the way they look now is mostly fine. That said, I would not show up to a Zoom call for work with a persona in its current state (though I also wouldn't show up using a persona probably ever for what it's worth). 

Another issue for future generations to work out: I can't see my iPhone. I would love if the Vision Pro could just display your iPhone's screen within the Vision Pro's screen. For dealing with annoying Duo notifications or checking emails quickly, this is a must-have for me, which mars the experience a little more.

Finally, I can't drink tea with this on. I'm sure that's funny but every time I lift my mug up to my face, it clinks against the visor and I have to be very careful about how I angle it to get a sip. I don't know if this can even really be solved for (maybe a slimmer facial profile?) and I know this is very silly, but it just leaves me asking myself ""why not just use a regular computer?""

In sum, this is a really amazing device that blew my mind when I first used it. However, beyond the novelty, it's left me feeling like I'm using a computer with extra steps. I will be returning it, but this thing has SO much promise. I went in wanting to love it as much as the demo, but it still just can't compete with my regular computer. In a few generations, it may be very competitive with that, but for now, it's worth skipping. Most people are average like me and won't have much use for it beyond cool movies and showing it to your partner who then asks ""why is there $3500 missing from our bank account?""",Average person's review of the Vision Pro,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1ahvgth/average_persons_review_of_the_vision_pro/

MineFirm,1707516779.0,,1an06z1,t3_1an06z1,98,90,"My summary scores of my first 7 days in!

&#x200B;

1. Vision OS & interface - **9/10**

Really enjoyable to use, eye tracking is a true wonder. Occasionally just misses things but not enough to be annoying. Pinching/ swiping/ zooming all work better than you can imagine

1.5 Passthrough - **5.5/10**

Was instantly incredibly underwhelmed with the quality looking at the real world, I'd read some people saying you can only just notice it's 2 x screens your eyes are looking at. My experience is far from that, even in pretty good light it's still very grainy, anywhere indoors there's a constant fuzz, like looking at the world through the original iPhone camera. Is obviously caused by the ISO adjusting in low light, found this to be the most disappointing area of the whole experience

2. Watching media - **10/10**

Nothing describes quite how good this thing is, had the latest Bond movie playing in what easily looks like a full size cinema screen in full 4K right in front of me. This is simply mindblowing

3. Apps - **5/10**

The combination of me combining my US and UK Apple IDs already make things tricky but overall a pretty underwhelming launch set. Lots of 'iPad' compatible apps not opted into for vision pro by devs, something which if was compulsory for launch would've bumped score to 7.5/10 on this alone

4. Comfort - **6.5/10**

Feels great when you first have it on, but after about 20 minutes you'll definitely notice pressure on the front of your face, by 40 mins you'll want the thing off for a break. When this thing is eventually half as light by gen 3 say, it'll be a dream.

5. Battery - **7/10**

Right decision to not have even more weight on the face with the battery pack, you forget about having it in your pocket after a while. I've mainly used mine indoors and on a flight, most times also having it connected to mains power as well.

6. Ease of Use - **8.5/10**

A dream to swipe, pinch and drag as you please. A little confusing as to why they don't have a first time set up tutorial when you turn it on. However you get one in the store so by the time you fire it up you're away in no time

7. Cost - **7.5/10**

She's expensive but when you're in it's easy to see why. No other VR headset comes close to this, makes the Quest look like very primitive.

Overall - **8/10**

Was lucky enough to have a gen 1 iPhone, gen 1 Apple Watch, gen 1 iPad in their time and this does very much have that gen 1 feeling, all aside from the iPad perhaps (which of course had the benefit of launching with all of the hindsight of iPhone) this does feel like a very well executed but basic entry into the Vision Pro world. An insane thing to say for how good this is, as remarkable as it is you're instantly excited about where this thing is heading.

................

My wishes for Gen 2/ Vision Pro 2.0

\- FOV needs some work, you still feel you're slightly looking into the world with the black vignette visible around the outside - a 3rd party light filter might improve this should they come!

\- The ability to lock and leave windows even when you've turned the headset off. A very obvious one that's surely not far around the corner. Would make this thing 5% better alone, easily.

\- Deals with YouTube, Netflix and alike need to be worked out quickly. Using them in Safari works fine but again having these native apps right now adds another 5%

andylokandy,1708592949.0,,1ax2321,t3_1ax2321,34,87,"I‚Äôve been using VisionPro for a while now, and I kept running into this annoying issue with the eye tracking. Initially, it was super accurate, but after a bit, it started getting wonky and I had to recalibrate it pretty often. Plus, selecting objects with my eyes was a real brain drain. I had to concentrate so hard that I‚Äôd get mentally exhausted pretty quick.

But here's the kicker: I figured out why this was happening, and it turns out the problem and the solution are kind of linked.

The thing is, when we look at something, we don‚Äôt actually focus on a single point. Our eyes have this circular area on the retina that‚Äôs clear, not just a dot. So, when we look at an object, we're actually using the edges of this circle to cover it, which means our eyeballs aren't directly pointing at the object, but more towards the center (like straight ahead of our face).

Before this understanding, I need to retrain myself to look at objects using the center of our visual field, and this new habit can mess up our initial calibration.

So, what‚Äôs the fix? When you're calibrating, **don‚Äôt force your eyes to align perfectly with the calibration points**. Just glance over them quickly and intuitively. Usually, you won‚Äôt be directly on point, and that‚Äôs okay. Also, don‚Äôt follow a circle pattern when calibrating. Go for a more random approach ‚Äì left, right, up, down, diagonally, etc. This way, the calibration is way more accurate and you can just point and shoot!",We may all be wrong on doing eye setup,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1ax2321/we_may_all_be_wrong_on_doing_eye_setup/

NattyBoi4Lyfe,1705761902.0,,19bd9kg,t3_19bd9kg,78,86,"I've been working as an iOS engineer for about seven years, starting when the iPhone was already popular. 

Developing the Vision Pro now is like starting to develop iPhone apps when the iPhone first launched. There are a ton of apps compatible with the Vision Pro, but I'm interested in developing apps exclusively for it. There's an astounding amount of room for growth, as developers and designers are figuring out best practices and creative possibilities on this platform.

The Vision Pro stands out because, unlike its competitors that seem to require physical activity to get the most out of their headsets, it offers a more relaxed experience. Many people prefer this laid-back approach for entertainment. The Vision Pro seems to offer a comfortable experience similar to using a phone, but with potentially greater enjoyment.

I realize this first version of spatial computing isn't for everyone. However, we, as developers and designers, play a crucial role in shaping this platform's future. Apple has set high standards, and it's our job to meet and exceed them in terms of user experience.

The Vision Pro opens up exciting possibilities for the next evolution of the internet and social media. Imagine an immersive environment where social interactions are not limited to text or video, but extend to shared virtual experiences. This could redefine how we consume content, moving from passive scrolling to active, 3D engagement.

The platform is poised to revolutionize content consumption. Users could explore news stories, watch movies, or attend concerts in a virtual space, all while reclining or seated. This approach not only enhances comfort but also broadens accessibility, inviting a wider audience who prefer or require a more sedentary experience. The Vision Pro's potential for delivering immersive, yet relaxed digital interactions could redefine our relationship with the internet and social media, making it more engaging, inclusive, and comfortable.

This is just the beginning. Guess we all have to wait and see how it all unfolds.

It‚Äôs intuitive, precise, and feels much better than anything I‚Äôve used in the past (Vive, Quest 3, Quest Pro).

However, additional gestures would really send this thing over the moon. A few ideas:

* Replace the current (not great imo) control center gesture with simply holding your hand out flat and having CC appear where your hand is
* A five-finger reverse pinch (think throwing a ball straight in the air) could summon the Home Screen, while a five finger inwards pinch could hide it.
* A hand wave in either direction could function as back and forward in menus or Safari like side swipes on iPhone
* A hand out (like a motion to stop) could pause the media currently playing. A hand wave towards you (like a motion to come) could play the media
* A secondary finger tap, like the current pinch but with the thumb and another finger (pinky?), could bring up context menus like Haptic Touch

These are a bit imaginative, but I would love to see some expanded use of hand tracking. I feel like the capability is already there for more complex gestures like these. Not having to constantly hunt and peck at small buttons like back and forward in Safari would make for a smoother and less straining user experience.

Two things. All movies can benefit from 3D now, and all movies should be shot in 60 or 120 fps. The stark difference in the 3D quality between like No Time To Die and Avatar is insane. And the only difference is that one has almost 3 times the frame rate.

4) Use Travel mode for on the move useage! I used to this to go downstairs and wash dishes üòÇ. It disables a bunch of sensors but also removes any persistently following / spatially anchored windows.
 
5) If an app crashes, which it is bound to do during the first week of launch‚Ä¶ use the control center to close the app OR hold both the Digital Crown and the photo capture buttons to force quit the app that‚Äôs open.
 
6) Tired of having to click the Digital Crown to get to the Home Screen? A lazy way to bring the Home Screen up is to look and launch the at control center and click the Home Screen icon (looks like a honeycomb).
 
7) Just use your eyes and the pinch gesture for the keyboard entry. It‚Äôs significantly more accurate than trying to actually press the keys, and it‚Äôs also faster. Dictation is even better and faster, but there will definitely be situations where you won‚Äôt want to use dictation (on a plane, around family that‚Äôs making noise, in the restroom üëÄ jk jk).
 
8) Can‚Äôt find the theatre experience everyone is talking about? That‚Äôs because have to use the Apple TV app. This means that although 3D movies like Avatar 2 can be played for free with your Disney subscription, you‚Äôd need to buy it in the Apple TV+ app to get the option. The option is on the top left environment icon menu. Honestly though, the Disney app is pretty awesome on its own, so I‚Äôm cool not seeing them in the 100 ft theatre.

Nicinus,1708025099.0,,1arnq8q,t3_1arnq8q,30,79,"I guess I‚Äôm both an early adapter and not. I am easily persuaded if I feel a new technology moves the needle, but I‚Äôm not looking for gimmicks. I was sold on VR from the first android phone thingie and had the first couple of Quests. I was not convinced by the Vive and felt that although Quest was very interesting and impressive, it really felt like a technology preview without much practical utility after that first awe wore off.

The AVP to me is different. It is the first time I don‚Äôt see a screen door effect and the first time I can‚Äôt identify any pixels. This is a milestone for me. I think it is blurry on occasion, especially when I move my head around and the FOV is still restricting not to mention the bloody light seal that I find really uncomfortable. However, visually the gains outweighs this and I will torture the local Apple Store until I find a fit that works really well, as I know it is out there.

But what really sells me on this is a cliche, but it really is Apple. On my Quest I was depending on streaming my PC to the screen, and it was my main argument for finding a way to be productive in it. If you are invested in the Apple eco system the AVP is immediately different and there is a multitude of apps that I already use daily. I don‚Äôt think I have a true killer app for my iPad, but I am 100% dependent on my iPhone, and sometimes the iPad is a better device for writing stuff, check pdfs, watch YouTube or film, and so on. To me it is amazing that a product that lets me concentrate and be in a private world suddenly fits right in to my daily workflow. I remember Tim Cook saying when they launched the iPad that it becomes a very personal experience to sit in your favorite chair and browse the internet as if you are reading a magazine, and I feel this is similar, I can experience a lot of my daily tasks and routines in a much more inspiring way in the AVP. Having a main task in front of me while placing various windows around me, all while sitting in a chair by the lake, gives me a work or relaxation experience different from any other and it just works, because it is a device that fits in with my other devices. All my regular apps are there.

I realize I sound like the world‚Äôs biggest fan boy at the moment, but that‚Äôs not really it. I‚Äôve been keen on VR and the experiences it can offer for a long time, but I just haven‚Äôt been able to integrate it into my life, just like you could potentially do a lot of different things with an XBox, but you really won‚Äôt. Here I actually do.

I‚Äôm a strong believer in that if you use something frequently it is almost always worth the price. Like my iPhone, probably shouldn‚Äôt tell Apple, but I would pay $3,500 for it as well if that was the only option and I didn‚Äôt have one. I wouldn‚Äôt upgrade to a new one at that price though, so I can therefore totally understand those who wait. This part is truly personal as it is no matter how you look at it an expensive device and everybody have their own situation. Many companies, like console or printer manufacturers, subsidize their products in order to get to critical volume and lower manufacturing costs or make it back on games or ink but Apple did not choose that route, at least not with this first version. There is no point in wishing they had, but it clearly demonstrates that this version is for early adopters and that the real push will come when the product and the software market has matured. This is also fine by me, as I personally have an immediate use case. Do I have a $3,500 use case? I don‚Äôt know yet, it depends on much I will use it, but if it is something I will use anywhere near my iPhone then there is no doubt. None of us is getting any younger, and wait for something even better a year or two down the road in order to save $1,000 or $1,500 is not a choice I would make for my iPhone, and I hope this will be the same thing. What I‚Äôve seen so far has been outstanding and I really don‚Äôt want to stand at the station and looking at this train passing by.

Staycharmin,1707612486.0,,1anv9s3,t3_1anv9s3,79,86,"I grabbed the AVP last night after my demo‚Ä¶ I was really into it and it was much better experiencing it for yourself vs watching the marketing material. Once I set it up at home I tested it from 7pm until 4am. I woke up today and was in it again for from 11-5. Here were a few conclusions I made about it.

1. This is a window into the future.. I can see a myriad of use cases both at home, the office, and out in the regular world. It‚Äôs minority report shit, absolutely.

2. As a technologist, I can see why this was priced this way‚Ä¶ everything from the technology built in, to the software driving it, and the vast amount of R&D it probably took to get this out to market.

3. I initially thought it‚Äôd be heavy based on all the reviews but using the dual strap was recommended. I can affirm that it was much more comfortable and I never had any pain on my cheeks or forehead. I got fitted for a 21W and both the W and W+ light seals worked just fine. I didn‚Äôt find the unit heavy and it was quite comfortable.

4. Pass through wasn‚Äôt as good as expected, but hey, I can see pretty well and the sharpness of the UI is something to behold, esp when putting apps right in your face. Even apps far away were very readable and I had little to no trouble grasping the gestures and control mechanisms.

5. My one major gripe, was typing. I type very fast so the air keyboard and the look and pinch gestures bothered the living fuck out of me. It was so error prone, esp when trying to login to all the services I use with my crytpic ass passwords. Nightmare. I ran to Microcenter and found a slim Bluetooth keyboard from Anker for $19.99. I was at a coffee shop afterwards, paired it, and it was LOVELY to get the tactile feel of a keyboard back. It was then very easy to use my hands/eyes as a mouse and type on the keyboard when needed. In my opinion, for this to be a real ‚Äúcomputer,‚Äù the typing experience has to be up to standards. Once I did that, I was like shit I can really get real work done with this thing.

6. I initially was disappointed about the selection of the AppStore, but I went into my purchased apps and was delighted to see I could download many of my favorite and much needed apps to the AVP. I also am an active stock trader, so having Webull, Trading View, and MetaTrader available in AVP was a dream come true.

7. I am upset we don‚Äôt have many password managers available, namely LastPass. I absolutely need that so I can stop switching back and forth to my phone for passwords I need to gain access to sites/apps. 

8. The immersive experiences were absolutely awesome, although I wish some were a bit more high res. It‚Äôs like they traded resolution for spacial-ness, and I do photography as well so I know the 360 cam technology is not all the way there yet, for the average consumer. It was very pleasing however, and yeah when Alicia Keys started singing to me, I felt like I was there. Truly awesome! 

9. Battery life isn‚Äôt such a huge issue to me, as I‚Äôm always by some sort of wall power source and have MacBook chargers or Anker Powerbanks I can use. At home I‚Äôd plug it up like a normal computer and then I‚Äôd detach it from the wall if I walk around, and then plug it back in when I‚Äôm settled again. 

10. Siri and dictation in general seem so snappy and much faster than even my iPhone 15, which is a welcome thing. I use her to open apps, call people, respond to messages, so very basic stuff but it works quickly, so that‚Äôs a plus.

11. The speakers on the headset are much better than I thought they‚Äôd be and they left me immersed in many different forms of media, it just sounded really good. 

12. I haven‚Äôt synced up my MacBook yet, but I wish you could do that and have more than 1 screen. I also am hoping we could somehow virtualize or AirPlay our iPhone/ipad screens to this. This would be amazing and allow me to still have access to apps that aren‚Äôt native to AVP. Really hope this is coming.

13. My persona looks like the Walmart me. I almost got offended it made me look so old and ugly lmaoooooo.

14. FaceTime was awesome and I showed a friend my environments and all the apps I had up during screen sharing. I really like that I can communicate in this headset in my own world, so to speak. I wish there was an actual phone with all my contacts in it vs searching for names to make a FT call. Maybe there is a full contact list somewhere but it seemed to just show my favorites until I hit + and I could search for someone.

15. My one gripe is how dirty the light seal pad gets.. I washed mine this morning and it took a while to dry. I wish I had those sterile white sticky cloths that Apple uses during demos. It would help me keep it clean.

16. I was like fuck that, when Apple said for $3800 after tax, I get no case. I have a Peak Design sling bag I use for my cameras and I am able to fit my MacBook charger, AVP, AVP battery, and my slim Anker keyboard in there. So happy I didn‚Äôt shell out the cash for that.

17. Now I‚Äôm just hungry for more native apps and experiences. I really wanna sit in the stands at the Super Bowl or something. I love the experiences that treat you like you are right there!!! 


Overall, I love this thing and I‚Äôm excited for what‚Äôs to come. I‚Äôm not a fanboy of Apple but love their products because they just work. This device represents another innovation of theirs where they weren‚Äôt first, but did it the best in my opinion. I can see why the price throws some off, but I think it was worth every penny.

I sincerely don‚Äôt get it. From my perspective, if we look at the past history of successful product launches, I fail to see one where ‚Äúkiller app‚Äù was the thing that did it. In fact, I think you could almost make the argument to the opposite!

Nowhere is this clearer to me than the launch of iPad. We all remember it being mocked precisely BECAUSE of how, almost on the nose, it seemed to attempt to do absolutely nothing new than it‚Äôs more capable, slimmer, predecessor (the iPhone). Giant iPhone jokes abounded. No killer app.

But Steve gets on stage and talks about how it feels in your hands. Sells you this experience of what it would be like to read the NYT on it.

And THAT, I would argue, is all that matters. Rather than whether or not there will be killer apps, the question ought to be whether or not the AVP will provide enough of a compelling computing experience to justify its existence. You‚Äôll watch the same shows, do your Word processing, and whatever else you can today already do on one of the 4 different other types of computers you have in your home. But if doing those on the AVP gives you a differentiated enough experience that‚Ä¶ that could be more than enough.

Queasy-Armadillo-225,1707577545.0,,1aniavo,t3_1aniavo,173,77,"First off, I promise I'm not trying to dump on the AVP.  It's an amazing device that I've been waiting years for, and does some things incredibly well.  I just am feeling a lot of disparity between how Apple positions the AVP and the reality of what I've experienced.



I've had my AVP for a week, and while I generally have really enjoyed it, I keep running into dissonance when trying to actually be productive on the device.  I've been thinking a lot about what the challenges are, and I'm increasingly conceding that Apple really missed the mark on what I was hoping they would deliver to in the ""Spacial Computing Revolution.""  I'd value you all's thoughts on how you're handling these issues, and what you all's thoughts are on how where you realistically see this device positioned in a productive workflow.



I'll mention that I've had issues with tracking, passthrough quality, and especially glare, but these all seem to be areas where current technology is the limiting factor, and will get better with time.  The issues I'm more concerned with are the things that were actively implemented in strange ways that I feel makes the ""Spacial Computing"" tagline from Apple seem somewhat disingenuous, and make the device feel like it's solely for consumption--which is fine, but is nowhere near the revolution I was hoping for.



And before all of the ""it was just released!!!"" comments, I know that.  The thing is that this is Apple we're talking about, and on a product that was years and years in the making.  Apple does not cut corners, or launch before they are ready.  For a company who's main appeal is having things that 'just work,' I'm not ready to excuse every issues as an ""it will come."" Plus most of these features exist happily on products with the same architecture so solutions exist and seem to have been actively left out.



Issues:
Cannot Create or add pictures to albums in photos.  This is probably the dumbest limitation to me.  What in the world good is 1Tb of pictures to me if I can't meaningfully organize, sort, or collaborate with them?



Simple device interoperability.  There is no handoff, you can't ~~share clipboards~~*, can't accept phone calls.  This made setting the device up a PITA, and instead of feeling like the AVP replaced any devices, makes it feel orphaned and unwieldy.



Settings:  I can't count the number of times that I've wanted to make an adjustment to an app or experience to get parity with my iPad/iPhone/Mac, and the settings just don't exist.  The customization and granularity sucks, and this weaknes is super apparent in such an immersive environment.  And can someone please explain to me why tf there is no dark mode?




Windows:  There are no fixed view windows, there are no presets, there is no garuntee where apps are going to end up when you re-center your view after any length of use.  I would have thought that Apple had gained plenty of knowledge from Stage Manager to launch with SOMETHING to make standardizing workflows or at least some form of work spaces more elegant.




No inputs, and tyranical peripheral control:  I've never once complained about Apple removing ports, because I generally could see the logic and elegance in what they were going for.  But, a $4k 'computer' that has NO inputs other than cloud loading just isn't compatible with the reality of creation or productive computing.  I don't want to go through three other lengthy steps to get my photos from my camera, or to open a spreadsheet a Windows-using coworker has on a thumbdrive.  If you're staging this as a computer, but it requires another computer to be in any way competent...it's not a computer.  Even more than that, it's a 'computer' that will only work with the newest gens of Apple keyboards and trackpads... I get having to buy apple pencils for iPads, but why in the world do I have to spend $300+ to get primary input capabilities on a $4k 'computer'?  I can't even listen to my Airpods Max on my AVP, I feel like I'm losing my mind.




File management and file transfer:  Similar to above.  I get the limitations of the UI, and I understand that the filesystem has to be managed very deliberately on a device that could be hard shutdown by removing the battery at any time, but you can do almost nothing meaningful with files... even less than the iPad, which is already limited.




Overly Curated App Store:  I get that there aren't many bespoke apps yet, and that's fine, but the app store as is is miserable to use.  I don't want to see the 12 apps you recommend again and again, at least list out the iPad apps that are compatible as they are presented on the iPad so I can more efficiently look for solutions without having to 'search' and pray something relevant pops up.




Audio and casting support:  This is the biggest complaint to me, and where I really struggle to get Apple's ""Spacial Computing"" argument.  Apple has repeatedly said that this is not a VR device, and it's obvious that they want users to be able to interact with the world.....but they can't.  I can't airplay the podcast I'm listening to so my wife can listen with me.  I can't cast music to the kitchen for the family to enjoy while I cook, I can't transfer audio on my zoom calls to my office setup that I would like to be part of my ""Spacial Computing World"".  I feel like a digital island.




TL;DR, Apple has always had a lot of control over user's experiences, and I think that has historically been great.  The problem on a mixed reality device like the AVP is that these limitations don't just affect an app or a UI, they affect your entire interaction with the world and literally define what you can and can't do.  The device encourages users to incorporate the world into their computing space, then seems to put handcuffs on whenever you try.  Unless you buy a completely secondary computer to mirror the screen on the AVP.......which, while awesome, completely misses the point for me.




It seems like Apple has left its users to decide what the AVP is actually 'for,' but then tells them they can't do that.




I'm honestly not trying to crap on the device, I've been waiting for it for literal years, I just feel like I was promised a computing revolution, and have been delivered a movie theatre and roped-off environment that lets me see but not meaningfully interact with anything on my device that I care about, and now I have one week left to divine if Apple is going to address any of these issues, or if they just misrepresented what their vision for the device is.  




What are the thoughts of the rest of you who are trying to actually use the device for productivity?



**Edit**:  Since the V1 issue keeps coming up--things like FOV, blur, imperfect eye tracking/click registration? THOSE are v1 issues, those are technical limits that are being met and frontiers being expanded, which is very different than missing implementations of existing features.

I have no problem showing grace where due, but I see no reason to make excuses for one of the most valuable companies in the world failing to meet expectations in areas they should be excelling.

gwinerreniwg,1707347744.0,,1algse2,t3_1algse2,39,77," One of the standout features of the Apple Vision Pro is its ability to record and playback spatial videos‚Äîa feature I was keen to test out. I had the perfect opportunity during a visit to my parents' house, where I recorded a simple moment: sitting at their breakfast table, chatting and eating, with the morning light casting a warm glow over the scene.

To put it mildly, my wife was less than thrilled when I first mentioned my new tech acquisition.

Today, I finally persuaded my wife to try the Vision Pro, showcasing its various features before culminating with the playback of that breakfast scene. Watching her reaction was something I hadn't anticipated. As the scene unfolded, immersing her in that sunny kitchen with my mom's familiar gaze meeting hers, the emotional impact was palpable. It was as if we had captured that moment in time so vividly, so tangibly, that she was transported right there, to that very table.

As the video wrapped up, I saw her eyes start to water. She looked right at me and was like, ""You're not returning this, are you?"" Just like that, all her doubts vanished. She was genuinely moved by how real those moments felt, captured through the lens of this device.

That moment reshaped my view of the Vision. It's more than just an impressive piece of technology; it's a portal to revisiting cherished moments, offering a glimpse into the future of how we capture and relive our memories. this piece of tech, which some might see as just another fancy toy, ended up meaning a whole lot more.

I've shot over 300 of these since getting my Vision Pro, and viewing them on the headset is a **STUNNING** experience. They absolutely blow away spatial photos captured with the Vision Pro itself.

I haven't used it for anything else because the videos look terrible, mostly due to bitrate/resolution issues rather than the Quest 2's screen/lenses. And most games are either garbage or make you dizzy.

A few days ago, I got the Quest 3. While the lens clarity has improved significantly and the resolution is a little bit better, there's still an irreparable flaw: motion sickness. Additionally, video quality remains poor due to the lamentable content quality on Meta Quest TV. YouTube's app is also affected, and now there's a bug limiting the Quest 3 to a maximum quality of 1080s. In contrast, on the Quest 2 and Quest 1, you could easily watch videos at 4096s (that it's also not enough quality, pixels look like stones)

The ability to consume content should be a top feature of the device since that's what attracts the masses (and Apple understands this well). However, Meta seems indifferent.

But the worst part is the motion sickness. I tried Assassin's Creed Nexus VR that came out yesterday, set it to full immersive mode using the joystick for movement, and it was terrible‚ÄîI felt dizzy within seconds.

Other options to avoid motion sickness completely ruin the sense of virtual reality. They either confine you in dive goggles or make you move in a choppy manner, etc.

No, masses are NOT going to want to adapt to this, at all. They're not us/you

The future seems to lean more towards Augmented Reality, as hinted by Apple's headset. And then, in specific situations, enabling an immersive mode for watching content. Apple is not solving motion sickness but rather creating experiences that avoid it. 

Nevertheless, I appreciate Meta's efforts, but with their current trajectory and strategy, there's a long way to go before Mixed Reality becomes a reality.

In my opinion, Apple's strategy is better, and will bring MR to the place we all want it to be‚Äîcreate a super expensive headset that is spectacular, and people will be amazed. This will spark interest in Mixed Reality, and prices will drop in a few years.

Meta makes a mistake by focusing on the wrong experiences. Apple gets it right; in their Vision Pro videos, everything is calm experiences because they know those are the ones that truly work.

And of course, they've equipped the Vision Pro with impressive screens to astonish people with content playback and productivity, this is what will propel it to stardom.

Designating a headset for mediocre games or games that make the masses dizzy is certainly not the key to success.

&#x200B;

Certainly, augmented reality is the future. Moreover, you feel strange when you take off the headset and return to your normal reality without being able to interact. Especially when, instead of using controllers, you use your hands. Vision Pro is focusing exactly on that, not a coincidence.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

PS:  The part I liked the most about Assassin's Creed is the beginning, where you're on a call and have to solve a puzzle by moving around your house, but in augmented reality instead of virtual reality. Then it switched to virtual reality, and the immersion and enjoyment went downhill because it just looks really cheap and makes you dizzy.",Meta's strategy with Mixed Reality is not the correct one - Apple gets it right with their Vision Pro,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/17xeqls/metas_strategy_with_mixed_reality_is_not_the/

I‚Äôve been using the Apple Vision Pro since day one, and I have found a way to increase my eye tracking accuracy by 10x. I can now easily select the smallest icons from across the room without having to blow things up.

So here‚Äôs how you do it‚Ä¶

FIRST make sure you‚Äôre running the latest Vision OS. 

- go to the control panel and redo your eye tracking.
- when the first dot appears, look and click.
- turn your head in another direction for the next set of dots and go through them fast and randomly (not in a circle). 
- turn your head again, do the same thing with the next set of dots. 
- turn your head again and do the same thing with the last set of dots.  

It may improve even more if you move your head WHILE selecting dots around the circle.. you don‚Äôt have to move it fast, but move your eyes fast and select the dots quickly.   The idea here is the randomization of your head movements increase your eye tracking accuracy.

Try it, and Report back with your results.

Pass-though: I find the pass-through to be pretty damn good. Of course it‚Äôs not as sharp as real life. But let‚Äôs keep in mind that you aren‚Äôt going to be spending your time staring at the room you‚Äôre sitting in. You‚Äôre going to be looking at apps and content. And apps and content look SUPERB.

Eye tracking: Utterly amazing. Apple nailed it in my opinion. Spacial positioning of objects is REMARKABLY solid and ‚Äúlocked in.‚Äù

Movies: A true cinema quality experience. The illusion of looking at an IMAX-sized screen is convincing. The picture is insanely sharp and detailed. Colors are vibrant and accurate. 3D movies look fantastic. (So far, I‚Äôve sampled: Blade Runner 2049, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Gravity, MI: Fallout). If you‚Äôre a die hard cinema fan and you have the means, Vision Pro is almost a no brainier.

3D Environments: Breathtaking. Can‚Äôt wait until Apple releases new environments. Enough said. 

Sound: The sound quality out of the headset is surprisingly dynamic and spacious. I‚Äôve spent most of my time using the headset with my AirPods Pro though (because the bass response is better).

App Selection: About what you‚Äôd expect for a brand new product. It‚Äôs early days. Still, there‚Äôs a nice selection. I look forward to more apps coming out over the next few weeks. 

Weight: Yep, it‚Äôs a bit heavy. I‚Äôve been doing fine with the solo band so far. Haven‚Äôt tried the other one yet. Admittedly, three hours of use has left my face a bit red. 

I was skeptical after reading the reviews. Especially the one from The Verge. But I knew after ~45 minutes of actual use‚Äîthere is no way I‚Äôll be returning this. Apple Vision Pro is a keeper.

A lot of people criticized this specific part of their reveal video because of the idea that a father would wear such a device during a birthday and. ""disconnect"" from the other birthday celebrants.

[Spatial Video capture on iPhone 15 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/sjp2ek8gpynb1.png?width=3638&format=png&auto=webp&s=870df0e84b4f1dbe73da236b328cb7175737585e)

Well, today Apple revealed that the new iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max can capture Spatial Videos. Spatial Videos are technically known as Multiview High Efficiency Video Coding (MV-HEVC) files - a standard which has been in development for over a decade. The MV-HEVC approach to 3D video involves encoding two slightly different views of the same scene (left and right) into a single video frame. This is based on a technique called ""2D Plus Delta,"" where the delta (or differences) between the left and right images are determined and encoded. This allows 2D decoders to use the base 2D view (usually the left eye view), while 3D decoders can calculate and present both views to the corresponding eyes. **In simpler language, a MV-HEVC video can be watched in either 2D or 3D display modes.**

Adding the ability for an iPhone user to create 3D video content will drive the desire for users to be able to view such content‚Ä¶ on an Apple Vision Pro. Over time, the user experience of seeing one‚Äôs own media in a new and highly immersive format will be very positively received. I'm excited that Apple enabled this to happen **before** the release of the Apple Vision Pro and not after.

Technical Note: iOS 17 beta documentation shows a preset for capturing these videos at 960x960 and 1440x1440 (square) formats. I don't see presets which match the apparent 16:9 ratio that was shown in today's Wanderlust event video but I imagine there will be range of capture presets enabled later this year.

deuceklub,1707566018.0,,1aneoea,t3_1aneoea,75,67,"I went into AVP without a lot of time vested into reviews and videos, because I enjoy figuring things out myself. IT Pro for 20 years. Here are some things I love/hate:

1. Apple + ALICIA KEYS SOLD ME! exclusive content like this WILL be the differentiator. 

3. Everyone says it, profiles. Gotta be able to save config of windows to come back

4. Mac Virtual Display is amazing. As most corporations will require mobile device management to have access to native apps like Teams, Outlook, etc. being able to emulate my Corporate laptop makes productivity possible. 

3. MacBook Desktops should be able to be brought in AVP or spread to new monitors

4. Price, everyone gasps at the price but I have an iPhone 12. I‚Äôve basically paid for the AVP by not upgrading and I‚Äôll pass on the 15 this year also. 

5. Solo experience, one of the biggest downfalls is that it creates an excluding experience, great for work to some extent but terrible for home and interacting with significant others and kids. 

6. Passthrough, yeah I know the limitations but just wearing 24/7 with passthrough vision is like walking around in 720p vs 4k. I‚Äôll happily sit at work or even lunch, but walking around the value isn‚Äôt there for me plus not as if you‚Äôll be on apps as you walk. 

7. Fit. I don‚Äôt mind the single band, it‚Äôs become more comfortable. Terrible if you lean forward or down to pick something up. I‚Äôm also monitoring its contact point with face at the top of my cheek to see if it‚Äôs causing a rash or bump.

I purchased a metal case to hold it (and used the online AR at Apple to get a picture). Hoping it fits but I have faith.  I‚Äôm going add an internal 50A battery to the case with a USB port that I can plug the AVP into for extended periods.

I also purchased an external charger that I can also keep in the case to refill the battery when not in use.  I may add another port to ease that process as well.

I got a thin Bluetooth keyboard with trackpad that I tested on my iPad Pro, which feels really good and fits well inside the case while allowing for closure.  This is for writing and creating documents using the AVP.

I‚Äôm trying to get my eye prescription updated this week so that I can order the inserts with the preorder.  If that doesn‚Äôt happen, I got a set of cheaters that sit on the nose only to at least allow me to use the Vision while waiting on the prescription lenses.  I tested these on my FPV goggles for RC and they work pretty good.  Not great long term, but I needed a solution until my prescription lenses arrive, in case I can‚Äôt order them during preorder.

Lastly I ordered some wipes to use on my face before each time I put the AVP goggles on, which will help keep them clean longer.  They will also help when allowing others to try them out.

That‚Äôs it for the moment.  As I get more antsy, we‚Äôll see what else my mind comes up with while I wait.",Already bought accessories,0.89,https://i.redd.it/kjw59kxgpacc1.jpeg

You'll have to enable the WebXR flags in AVP Safari settings, but this only takes a moment - [here's a video](https://twitter.com/jamesckane/status/1747327644570362366) showing how to do it.

[Here's the full game trailer](https://vimeo.com/879963837) and here's some footage of the game running on AVP after we added hand tracking. Let me know if anyone's able to try it! There's nothing like it on Apple's platform right now.

natiahs,1706898121.0,,1ahaehx,t3_1ahaehx,68,66,"Initial thoughts after a couple hours with Apple Vision Pro:

This is by far the best HMD I‚Äôve ever used, and I‚Äôve used about a dozen of them from Rift DK2 to Vive to Quest 1/2/3 to PSVR 1&2 to HoloLens. Vision Pro blows them all away, and it is not close. It is comfortable with a gorgeous display.

There are plenty of Day 1 bugs, mostly from Apple‚Äôs own apps. I can‚Äôt get the eye ID working, and the 3D movies in the Apple TV app are not displaying in 3D.

Disney+ has 46 movies in 3D. They look fantastic and the environments are great. I haven‚Äôt wavered from my dedication to not watching anything Star Wars related in 25 years, but there‚Äôs a strong chance this is good enough to get me to try Rogue One.

I haven‚Äôt launched DJay yet, but once I do I expect I‚Äôll be there for a while.

Immersive videos are insane (180-degree 8K video with Spatial Audio), but there are some rookie mistakes with the editing of the clips. For example, in the first Alicia Keys song, she is walking directly toward you when suddenly the viewpoint cuts to a location across the room. It‚Äôs very jarring! If you want to have multiple camera angles in Immersive Video, let the viewer choose if and when to switch.

Prescription lenses just arrived, so time to pop out the contacts and get those installed!

EDIT: Got Optic ID working by running the Day 1 firmware update. Should have done that first!

EDIT 2: Wait, so neither Hearthstone nor Marvel Snap's Ipad apps are supported? BOO! I wanted to run those side by side!

EDIT 3: If you want a few more Immersive videos, grab AmazeVR concerts. There are 3 free tracks you can download - one each from T-Pain, UPSAHL, and Zara Larsson. The sets are $13 each, but there is a free song from each set available.

EDIT 4: Updating the firmware did NOT fix the Apple TV 3D problem. I can select a 3D movie and click ""Play in 3D,"" but it only playing back in 2D.

EDIT 5: 5 Hours Later: A lot of apps don't control the way I'd like them to. Game Room is kind of wonky and provides the worst version of computer Solitaire I've ever experienced. I can't get Puzzling Places to work right; it was designed for chunky controllers and the game doesn't really understand finger manipulation. The T-Pain Immersive video is aggressive, but then they do some really weird camera thing where he slowly sinks below you for a moment. It's over quickly, but such an odd choice. Encounter Dinosaurs was strange in that it wants you to think it is roomscale but it only works in a narrow space about three feet in front of where you started. 

But hot golly if Synth Riders not downright exquisite. And I've been playing around with DJay a bit - the Spatial studios are more limited than the flat version, but there's no question that being able to lift and drop the needle, scratch, and do crazy 3D audio effects by reaching into boxes is very compelling. And now it integrates with Apple Music, so I was able to mix The Blessed Madonna's ""Happier"" on release day.

They thought it was kinda a ""cool"" gadget, but they didn't know that they were holding the future of mobile computing in their hands. 

Kinda feel the same with AVP. I feel like we are about to see computing change dramatically. It'll take some time but this is no doubt the start. But I feel that most people are not aware of what's going on.

People are expecting 3D objects for every app.

But 3D UIs have been explored before decades ago by Microsoft and Sun Microsystems when computers started having better graphics cards.

Even Microsoft Bob could be considered a spatial UI.

Apple also experimented with non-rectangular widgets floating above the desktop and in the Garage Band app.

In the end society converged back to rectangular flat windows because it was the easiest to operate and the most productive.

Also matching existing skeuomorphic objects is not the answer. Physical objects like a calculator on a table are a limitation that should not be replicated.

The space is completely free of distractions, letting you focus on the content. Unlike the built-in player, you can truly move the screen anywhere, make it as big as you like, and watch in an environment with nothing except your content.

Link: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cinephile/id6478435850](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cinephile/id6478435850)

Features:

* Freely resize and reposition videos anywhere, including the ceiling
* Add ambient light from the video to enhance presence
* Hide your hands to eliminate distractions
* Prevent accidental taps with long-tap mode
* Pin the playback bar anywhere or let it follow your gaze with tracking mode
* Change the background color to avoid lens glare and complement the video
* Supports subtitles, both embedded and separate files (SRT, VTT)
* Adjust subtitle height, size, and background in real time
* Switch between 8 playback speeds
* Remembers your settings between sessions
* Videos save in a convenient library sortable by name, size, and date
* Supports partial passthrough, so you can quickly check your surroundings anytime

Cinephile currently supports 2D videos compatible with the built-in player. If your video plays in the Files app, it should play in Cinephile.

Look forward to future updates, including expanded file compatibility, media server (edit: network/streaming) support, and realistic environments!

natiahs,1707795170.0,,1apjopt,t3_1apjopt,33,65,"I didn't think it was necessary to make this post, but the report today that showed most AVP owners aren't downloading apps was eye opening. I'm excluding pre-installed apps and iPhone / iPad apps that run in compatibility mode. I'll start with an obvious one and then hopefully hit some you may have overlooked:

1. Disney+. Obviously. 3D movies and immersive environments. No-brainer.
2. DJay. A true mobile classic which made its debut on iPad in 2010 and has consistently improved since then. It reaches AVP with full Apple Music integration and spatial mixing. It is resource intensive - I don't recommend running it alongside other apps - but the experience is excellent. Cut, scratch, and throw in effects by reaching into 3D containers. It's a blast. Tip - it launches in flat mode; click the 3D box icon between the turntables to launch into immersive DJ environments.
3. Synth Riders. AVP's Beat Saber, except instead of slicing notes you groove along sweeping tracks. Can be played with or without an immersive environments. Free with Apple Arcade.
4. Amaze VR. 3D180 VR concerts! There are only 3 so far: T-Pain, Zara Larsson, and UPSAHL. Each consists of 4 songs, runs about 15 minutes, and costs $12.99. But there's also a free song for each artist, so you don't have to spend $$$ to enjoy some quality immersive content.
5. Microsoft Suite (Teams, Excel, Word, PowerPoint). I primarily work from home, and these make that much easier. I use a laptop connected to a 65"" TV. I usually have e-mail opened on the laptop and whatever I'm RDP'd into on the TV. Now I can have Teams running to the right of the TV and Excel running on the left, each in a screen larger than the 65"". It is very nice being able to offload the Microsoft apps into virtual space.
6. PGA Tour. I'm not a golf fan, but this is a very cool app. You can watch clips on the big screen, see standings and stats on sidebars, and watch the progress of each hole on a zoomable rotatable 3D model that sits between you and the screen. Or you can enter immersive mode and watch from the course! I just realized I should have ranked this number FORE, but I'm not changing the list now.
7. Jetpack Joyride 2. Finally, I can play Jetpack Joyride without blocking part of the screen with my sausage finger! The game itself is relatively unchanged from the mobile version, just with a slight 3D effect on the playfield. The playfield is presented in an immersive environment, and explosions and effects burst through the screen into the environment. Very fun.
8. TRIPP. I've always been a sucker for visualizers. This one isn't the best, but it does have the rather excellent ""Ascend"" immersive video. Worth a watch!
9. IMAX. Very barebones at the moment but being able to watch IMAX films in their original aspect ratio in a branded immersive theater that is convincingly similar to the one at the local science center is pretty great. There's one free movie and 2 that you can rent for $6.99 each.
10. TestFlight. This is how you can try pre-release apps. A decent number of devs are publishing links to their works-in-progress on X.

A couple that are not on the list, but I'm assured are excellent - NBA App (I don't have a subscription) and Moonlight (there's an AVP version accessible through TestFlight, but I don't have a gaming PC).

kevink808,1708207971.0,,1atdv82,t3_1atdv82,296,62,"TL:DR - Vision Pro haters spend so much time here because of normal human psychology: they want one and they don‚Äôt like that some of you have one, and they feel threatened that Vision Pro owners think they are better than them.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

It‚Äôs pretty interesting to see so many people who profess not to like, care about, and have zero interest to buy, expend SO much energy on r/VisionPro trying to convince those of us who bought one it was a bad purchase, dissuade prospective buyers not to, or convince us all why they didn‚Äôt.

But it‚Äôs not surprising. The concept of ‚ÄúInequality Aversion‚Äù is a human behavior typified by: *‚Äú‚Ä¶the tendency of individuals to avoid situations where they perceive that there is an unfair distribution of resources or benefits. This concept is based on the idea that people have a strong preference for fairness and are motivated to maintain a sense of equity and justice in their interactions with others. Inequity aversion can influence people‚Äôs behavior in a variety of ways, such as through their willingness to cooperate with others or their willingness to participate in social exchanges. It is an important factor in understanding human behavior and decision-making.‚Äù* 

https://www.thebehavioralscientist.com/glossary/inequity-aversion

This behavior can be observed in our primate cousins as well. The Apple Vision Pro at $3,500 replete with Apple marquee branding, superior specs to competing products, and ironically - due to its reduced value proposition in terms of product immaturity and market readiness relative to cost - is perceived by many as even more of a luxury purchase.

But while the Vision Pro is expensive, it‚Äôs not necessarily out of reach to many when credit is easily accessible to even the poor. A frivolous purchase is just a credit card swipe away. But there is a difference between accessibility and affordability.  That‚Äôs part of the reason why many bought a Vision Pro on credit to experience it, but returned it within Apple‚Äôs generous 14 day return window when the prospect of payments and interest were imminent. 

And therein lies the rub: most people don‚Äôt generally envy the rich, they envy those perceived to be in the same social class.  If the Vision Pro was $200,000, most of us wouldn‚Äôt even entertain the idea of owning one. Does the idea of the rich banker buying a Lamborghini elicit feelings of envy in you?  Probably not. But the Vision Pro isn‚Äôt $200,000, it‚Äôs just expensive enough to be difficult to justify for many, but affordable enough for the few who buy it anyway.

Reference Group Theory *‚Äú‚Ä¶predicts that the poor (rich) envy others from the same social group or class. ‚Ä¶.while across class envy is common; within class envy motivates the most anti-social behaviour.‚Äù*. 

https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/925717/within_and_across_class_envy_anti-social_behaviour_in_hierarchical_groups.pdf

In other words, the sharp increase in trolling-like behavior towards Vision Pro owners or prospective buyers among other VR/AR enthusiasts can be linked to the feeling that their position in the social class is threatened (implied inferiority). Such people are simply offended that others can spend more freely and frivolously, and this is accompanied by a perceived reduction in social ranking: Class envy.

1. For context, there are <12k people on this sub and even less on the Discord. I'd venture that the Venn Diagram of early adopters willing to shell out this much money for a V1 of a product and those who use Reddit probably has a bit of overlap.
2. The BASE PRICE is $3500, but there is little chance that's what you walk out the door paying. After sales tax, prescription lenses, and whatever other accessories Apple comes up with I'd be willing to bet the price tag is closer to $5k than to the $3500 for most people. That's a lot of disposable income, especially considering the impact of recent inflation on consumers.
3. It's only a US release. My guess is that they restrict the purchases to those who are verified Apple customers who live in the US. I also wouldn't be surprised if they gave first crack to those who are registered in their developer community, as that is clearly their target customer.

Stood in the same spot for both, put tape down exactly where I couldn‚Äôt see anymore

My guess for why it‚Äôs skewing in Vision Pro‚Äôs favor for me; the Quest 3 lenses require an additional magnetic mount that Vision Pro has built in. The lenses are roughly the same thickness, the mount adds an additional 3mm (didn‚Äôt measure exactly)

I suspect most with a prescription did not get lenses for the Quest. So maybe for them, the FOV is better for Quest with glasses than Vision Pro with lenses and thicker light seal. I‚Äôm going to say they‚Äôre actually a lot closer than everyone is suggesting

I will eventually measure again with Quest 3 and glasses, and then once again with contact lenses for both. In the meantime, if you decide to try it out yourselves, let me know what you find!

I'm currently working on a mindfulness app where users can visit different spaces and view 3d/spatial video. While social media has been increasingly focusing on fast, short form media, I'm treating spacial video very delicately and focusing on slower, longer form content. I'm hoping this allows users to escape to a place of calm and allow me to learn more about the medium itself.  


This is the first video that is nearing completion so I wanted to share and get any early feedback.

hughred22,1704481670.0,,18zeq5l,t3_18zeq5l,71,59,"I have a discussion on the Virtual Reality group about Apple Spatial Video. Here are some questions and I quote ""I kind of feel like you (me the OP) said it is marketing jargon. I mean the video is the same, minus an edge and a format type? Can an SBS MP4 be spacial video? Can an MV-HEVC be stereoscopic 3d? Not really grasping how an edge can have 6DoF either... I mean, it can track you, but that is more the software playing the video than the actual video... I would think."" (Credit Eric)  


This is my personal understanding and opinion (Please chime in as there are more experts in this group who can answer way better than I ever can):

1. Any SBS mp4 (all Hollywood 3D movies) can be Spatial Video. I have a tutorial coming up to show people how Hollywood is doing to convert them into Spatial Video (they want to make money on Apple's new platform, and 3D, in general, is way more expensive than 2D film, so...)

2. Any MV-HEVC can be stereo 3D for Meta Quest 3 or 3DTV. My other post on here already shows how. I can even stream LIVE MV-HEVC to any 3DTV (Apple might not be pleased about it, but I am one of those open-source guys who value accessibility more than Apple making all the money)

3. 6DoF or Volumetric Video is captured (or AI-generated) area the initial camera did not capture. Viewers have free head movement (6DoF movement) to see behind the screen like in real life - it is the most true-to-life immersive experience. Microsoft and others have been doing it for the past 5 years but it is so expensive they have to cut the losses. It is the future but it is not here yet (cost concern). Apple is smart and not want to go down that rabbit hole like Google...

4. 3D and Volumetric capture / Lightfield capture are fundamentally different. People think Apple achieved the latter but in fact not. But with AI generative tech supercharging the industry - it might be sooner than all of us think. Apple can buy it when it is mature and put it in spatial video / vision pro.

There are active researches in all these areas including NeRF / G-Splat that are coming in HOT to bring costs down so it is very possible we will have 6DoF video soon on Vision Pro. Single scan to 6DoF video is already possible in VR180. There are noise that need to be clear up but looking at how fast G-Spat 3D has grow in just the past 3 months. It is possible Apple can drop the ball and wow all of us and we will know soon end of this month.   


If you have insight in this topic, or questions, or disagree with anything I said. Please comment . 

This is my personal understanding and I can be so wrong. I am passioned in immersive filmmaking - I don't care if Apple labelled it Spatial Video or Google labeled it VR180 - as long as the immersive landscape is growing and more viewers are coming in - it is good news for the industry.

1) People buy headsets  
2) They're floored by new or improved technology  
3) The ""magic"" begins to wane with time  
4) The convenience and comfort of doing things the ""old fashioned way"" ultimately begins to outweigh the joy and novelty of doing them in VR  
5) Headsets gather dust

This is an obstacle inherent to every VR headset maker on the planet, whether it's a $99 Samsung Gear or a $3,500 Apple Vision Pro. Even with 4K micro OLED displays, strapping a box to your face is a hell of a lot less convenient way to watch/work/play/exercise than turning on your TV, working at your desk, playing a flat-screen game, or taking the dog for a walk.

To me, the real test for Apple is going to be creating use cases for the AVP that are so unique, so productive, so efficient, and so routine that they can't possibly be replicated in the ""real world,"" even with the ""magic"" of VR becomes routine.

I honestly just don't know if the experiences are out there yet, for any manufacturer, to propel VR from a novel alternate way to do things to a daily necessity worth the added hassle.

The lack of HDMI in on the AVP was a big disappointment for me. Especially as someone who wants to play PS5 on the headset.

&#x200B;

The remote play iPad app may work, but that comes with a quality hit.

&#x200B;

So after doing some thinking and reading, I think I found a solution.

&#x200B;

As far I know, you can connect to a MacBook with the AVP for a resizeable 4K feed. HDMI 2.1 capture cards that are Mac compatible now exist for gameplay capture.

&#x200B;

So I purchased this: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGD86HNB?psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&ref\_=chk\_typ\_imgToDp](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGD86HNB?psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp)

&#x200B;

And plan to connect it to my MacBook, then connect wirelessly to the Vision Pro. On paper, this will give me a 4K60 stream with HDR 10. With some luck, if I use the atmos preset on the PS5, theoretically, I may be able to get Spatial Audio support too.

&#x200B;

In theory, this should work with any device with an HDMI port. PC, Xbox, alternative set top box? Should all work just fine.

&#x200B;

I'll report back if anyone is interested.  


  
UPDATE:

So this worked pretty well, all things considered. Latency was noticeable, but for the games I play (JRPGS primarily) it was plenty playable.

That said, I don't recommend going this route. The setup of needing to connect everything doesn't provide enough of a quality upgrade over MirrorPlay (which has a Vision Pro compatible app) to justify the added complexity. Xbox has a similar app available too.

If you're looking to connect a switch, the fidelity is limited enough by hardware anyway to make a capture card of this quality overkill. There seem to be plenty of other options listed here.

Instead, let's talk a bit about what Apple is trying to *accomplish* with Vision Pro, specifically as it relates to the kinds of software you can create with it.

That is: if we take the goal of building *spatial computing* seriously, what could you build with that? Is it possible to achieve it using Vision Pro?

If so, how successful is this first generation of product? What would future iterations from Apple, and competition from other players, actually look like?

Is this actually going to work?

These are the questions that most capture me in this moment. Let me know what conclusions you reach.

# Business goals

I know I promised you a software discussion, but first let's talk about the motivations for the business entity that is shipping this product.

Apple wants margins. That's the Apple DNA: sell a thing that is more than the sum of its parts, through the combination of proprietary software, hardware and industrial processes. Make a thing only Apple can sell you.

Now, you can argue about the success of their differentiation, depending on the product line‚Äîthis is the point where Android people will chime in and let us know that Android gets all kinds of different features years sooner.

Reasonable people can disagree over the success.

But it's clear this has been the strategy, at least since the original Macintosh had its licensing business killed when Jobs returned.

So Vision Pro exists to create an opportunity sell you an experience no one else can.

If Apple has something like that, they can make all the margin they want. They have a monopoly on the intellectual property that allows the creation of Vision Pro-like experiences, as they have one on iPhone-like and Mac-like experiences. You can prefer an Android-like experience, or a Unix-like experience. You can prefer other things.

But for Apple things, they're the only game in town.

Vision Pro, in success, gives them a new IP monopoly and new high-margin revenues.

# Success at what?

So if that's what they're doing as a business, what they're doing in product is this:

They're selling holography.

The foreshadowing is, as usual, in Microsoft's baroque product matrix. Remember Hololens? It was augmented reality as the primary experience. Write whatever information you wanted into a fully 3D volume.

They made a go at this, hoping for another bite at the platform dominance angle. But they made the mistake of going to business users first, instead of building up the platform's culture from personal use.

Still, they tried: holograms.

We'd love to do this *without a headset*, but there's a problem: we don't fucking know how. Holography remains a science fiction technology, at least in the sense that we could build interactive, freestanding 3D software. The technology simply doesn't exist.

So if we can't create actual 3D holograms in physical space, we have one fall-back position to accomplish a similar experience. We can instead interpose an illusion over the eyes that *simulates* the existence of 3D images in the physical space around us.

If we can convince the brain the light exists, make the images parseable by the brain circuitry that we use every waking second of the day (for sighted individuals), then we don't need science fiction holographic projectors. We can fake it.

From there, we can create a completely new kind of software. Software that doesn't just have 3D appearance, but 3D behavior. Depth and volume. Things you can walk through, reach through. Things that follow your gaze. Things that fill the room around you. Hundreds of times more workspace than just one monitor.

So that's what happens you put on Vision Pro. You just see the world around you again. But now, extra stuff is projected over it. That extra stuff being *whatever developers imagine.*

The problem with this, of course, is computing power.

The eyes move fast. We're constantly sampling, constantly wandering. We have specific expectations about how light works.

And we see at a resolution that is computationally expensive to fully approximate, and more expensive still to recreate in physical pixels. Creating an image reliably enough to trick the eye at this level of intimacy is simply *challenging*.

Apple is, in 2024, launching at the absolute barest edge: trading off maximal quality of holographic illusion against profitability.

And we will be able to sense these physical tradeoffs when we get our devices.

# 30 minutes

Apple's ability to trade access for control in the press has served them perfectly here. Every demo of Vision Pro since summer time had a firm time limit.

Some of this, I'm sure, is practical. There's only so much time, so much staff, so many units. Press demand is basically unlimited here. But it also gets the reviewer out of the experience before fatigue can set in.

When I got the first iPad home, I could tell one thing immediately: v2 was going to be AMAZING. But v1 was merely interesting. It was very cool, but also just a smidge too heavy to use *comfortably*. You couldn't quite get lost or absorbed in your iPad activities. The weight kept you too conscious of the device, which distracted from the task.

Perfection in a digital experience is to make the physical details recede. Let the mind fully inhabit the sphere of imagination being co-created between software programmer and software inhabitor. A keyboard is a good example here. Once you're a proficient touch typer, you're not thinking about the keyboard. You're not paying attention to it visually, and the feedback from the keys exists entirely for way finding and confirming presses. You're thinking of words, and they're appearing on a screen. Your mind and focus exist *on the page*.

Vision Pro is going to miss this mark a lot in v1.

It's too early, and the problem is too hard for the reasons cited above. The device is bulky, you're going to feel the fact that you're wearing a weird electronic sock over your face.

I am certain that this is the absolute most comfortable solution for wearing such a sock. But we are not going to easily commune with the filmy veil of cyberspace in this version of the hardware. We're not going to *easily* or *sustainably* forget we're in there.

# So for v1, the game is making the most of the time we get

If we want to edit financial documents, we have an incredibly powerful, mature solution at hand. We spend $800 on a commodity laptop, install Excel, and create the ghost plumbing of any business we want.

You don't need to make spreadsheets in 3D. Whether you're a developer, or a spreadsheet user, this is not time well spent in the land of holograms.

What's something *only* volume can do?

*That* will be time well spent under the weight of this computer for the face. That's what Vision Pro users will go through the trouble of gearing up for.

An experience so compelling, so unique, the sensation of all this glass and metal strapped to the front of the head is not only worthwhile, but the least interesting data the body is actually receiving.

Apple's success rides on whether they make it easy enough to have amazing experiences that transcend the discomfort of a v1 device.

# Can they do that?

As a software developer and product designer, I just made a $4,000 bet that they can and they will.

Apple has been building a strategy around this for years. It's a little wild to see them actually bring all the threads together, like the latter half of a Game of Thrones season that suddenly connects all its storylines.

They've been shipping bits of hardware and software that contribute to this platform since 2014, when Swift was announced. Swift let them build SwiftUI, which lets you easily adapt your exist UI code across Apple platforms. They haven't won all the developer love they could for this, and so not everyone is a strong believer in the SwiftUI strategy that would make Vision Pro a slam-dunk port on day one.

Still, SwiftUI and Apple's accompanying frameworks, even if you started today, let you build a lot of cool shit quickly and without having to be an expert in all the math required to build a 3D experience.

They're leveraging other work too, like all they've built for AR in iPhones and iPad.

They've been shipping a LiDAR sensor for years.

In other words, while Vision Pro is new, its subcomponents, and their integration, have been quietly battle tested for years ahead of this launch. Despite being a v1, much of the developer tooling that feeds it all is pretty mature.

More than that, there are so many developers who already know how to write this stuff, and they've been building for iPhones, iPads and Macs in this language for a decade. That means that Apple has maximal chances of finding the set of experiences that keep people coming for more hologram time.

Nothing is promised. But Apple has played the game well.

# What comes next?

By market cap, Apple is a three trillion dollar company.

They had $162 billion in cash sitting around last year. These numbers are unfathomably large. It's a lot of room to place bets and shape the landscape.

Rumor sites say that by 2027, they're going to ship a v2 of Vision Pro. (Sometime ahead of that, they'll ship a cheaper, simpler, non-pro device, having gotten manufacturing yields up on all the crucial components. Happens with consoles all the time.)

Let's assume that's true. Three years is a lot of time to let hardware mature. The current device is using M2-grade chips, with this configuration dating to 2022's release. We can already buy M3-based Macs, so you can imagine quite a leap forward in performance for a 2027 iteration. That will make the vision illusion department of things even more successful.

That's also more time to find ways to change the weight and balance of the device. The battery offloaded to the hip shows how desperate the situation is, and it means that unlike with phones and tablets, energy efficiency won't translate immediately to lighter weight. They'll have to find their gains elsewhere.

Still, if they could capitalize a v1, bet on the fact that they're already paying to build the v2. It just takes that long.

And when they ship it, it'll be less clunky, more comfortable. You'll last a little longer, go a little deeper, be that much more absorbed by the content than you are distracted by the hardware.

# So that's what they're doing

They want to build a platform based on spatial volume, not just flat planes.

They want to make it possible to build inside that volume with the same ease you build for the iPhone or iPad.

They're constrained by the laws of physics and the limits of human technological prowess in computing devices.

And if they make it just good enough that you don't mind the clunkiness, they get to make a bunch of money. It only works if the developers figure out interesting stuff that creates enormous value in the spatial computing context, such that an hour spent wearing the headset accomplishes things that are impossible to match any amount of time outside of it.

It's a tall order. But I see the mechanics, I see what they brought to the party, and I think they've got a better chance than anyone else who has taken a swing so far.

This has already gone on far too long, but my parting thing is: I bet Microsoft is much more capable of competing with Apple for King of Holography than Meta is. I bet they killed HoloLens because they're rebooting their program. It's gonna be a personal productivity rematch for these old titans, while Meta sighs and abandons the hardware to finally build a 3D social platform people use.

onlyouwillgethis,1704146301.0,,18w7z8f,t3_18w7z8f,47,53,"I think that for all those who are fascinated by the tech but think it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs still too heavy, janky, or perhaps too abstract/futuristic/gimmicky‚Ä¶ they will find that their opinion changes about the entire value proposition and profound meaning behind this product once they actually experience it.

And no, it wont be because of how moved and impressed they will be by the hyper-realistic AR graphics (that will help for sure).

It will be much more so because of well Apple has executed its classic Apple UX magic in terms of making this thing essentially a ‚Äúmind reader‚Äù.

That‚Äôs the real secret gameplan here imo.

AVP is an example of tech that will offer fluency and ease for all your computing needs to a pedigree never been possible before in the history of technology thanks to the genius combination of eye tracking, reliable AR, and high fidelity hand tracking.

It will do this SO well and so reliably that your brain will feel a rush of being augmented by technology like it has never felt before (the kind that humans probably felt only with the first Mac and iPhone).

Having said this, I‚Äôm not saying that this will suddenly make people want to shell out the ridiculous money for it or put up with the whole weird external battery situation and major lack of useful apps available at launch. Those are still huge hindrances in terms of viral adoption.

I‚Äôm simply trying to say that I think this is what Apple is banking on the most: The mind-reading factor.

They know that nobody can do it like them (fingers crossed).

They understand that to get humanity to start adopting this admittedly awkward face goggle tech as the new norm forever isn‚Äôt just going to be about high immersion and a slim Rayban like profile, it is equally going to be (if not more so) about the device offering a magical ‚Äúmind-reading‚Äù tech experience.
