For example, with a flat view as in the OP video you can almost ignore actual and rendered Z-depth, as masking takes care of occlusion, and masking can be close-enough because you gave no object edge cues other than the masking (i.e. if you get the edge of an object incorrect, the 'wrong' edge becomes the new 'correct' edge as long as it's vaguely close).

\- Both for Android and iOS, No LiDAR is required.  
\- See your model in Augmented Reality.  
\- You can export in glb, usdz, fbx, obj and stl with more formats going to be added on future.  
\- Embed the scan to your website to showcase your product in AR and 3D.  
\- Measure your scan, for example, your room, furniture etc.  
\- You can edit your scan, crop it and rotate it.  
\- Nerf is going to be integrated in the future.

_echo3D,"This is really amazing! Apple's native AR app to create 3D models will be a game-changer for many people who want to start creating 3D models and don't know how to code. I'm wondering how smooth the textures will be and if their processing engine will smooth these 3D models out in the backend.

The only thing about creating all these 3D models on your iPhone is that they will take up a lot of storage space. The best solution for this is to store them in the cloud to reduce storage space. Since it's a native iOS app most likely we're going to be looking at USDZ file formats.

If you plan on using your 3D models for apps, games, or creating XR experiences, **echo3D**'s 3D digital asset management platform will allow you to store, edit, update, and stream all your 3D models in real-time. There's SDKs and integrations built-in with Unity, Unreal Engine, iOS, ARKit, etc. so that creating 3D content is a lot easier. You can even compress and convert your 3D models automatically for whatever application you need it for.

If anything, this is an unnecessary restriction to a single physical location when you could use your AR device to overlay it on any wall at your convenience.

LackOfABetterNombre,"I hear you, and those are some creative solutions.

The way I'm looking at it, it wouldn't be a primary way of checking any of that information. A more likely real-world application would be for when AR glasses are common. Assuming we're still pulling out our credit cards to make payments, the glasses could pick up the card once it's in your FOV and trigger that info to come up (maybe with a gaze-based password or something). The card fits in your palm, so you wouldn't be waving it around to do the swipe gestures.

Realistically any fears of somebody taking a picture of your card could already be accomplished. They'd need the front and back for the security number though, and I'd say overall that threat seems low. But I hear your concerns.

Undoubtedly nifty little application though.","<div class=""md""><p>I hear you, and those are some creative solutions.</p>

mjbvz,"Thanks! Glad you enjoyed the app

[This post](http://blog.mattbierner.com/reality-shaders/) covers the basic implementation. The concept is actually pretty straightforward (although it took me a while to fit together all the pieces the first time):

\- Place a virtual plane in the scene.

\- Texture that plane using scene background image (the camera feed). If done correctly, the plane should now blend perfectly into the scene. I do this texturing in the plane's fragment shader 

\- Then distort the plane. You can distort both the texture sampling or you can distort the geometry itself. For this app, the plane is being distorted to have three dimensional waves. The key to the 3D distortion is that you keep using original texture coordinates of the undistorted plane. The result is a 3D AR object that's textured with the texture of the surface it was placed on.","<div class=""md""><p>Thanks! Glad you enjoyed the app</p>

eriwer,"Hi everybody! 

I created this unnecessary-ish but totally necessary AR app for android mobile.

Banana for scale is available on the android play store.

It's a basic AR app for quick banana measurement. 

It includes:

Placing banana

Rotating banana 

Duct tape banana as seen on TV 

Photo functionality 


It uses plane detection for placing the AR banana objects. This means that you sometimes have to move your phone like an idiot in order for it to work. 

Flat surfaces with contrast often work best.

Free version:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Wildfyre.BananaForScaleFree 

Paid version:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Wildfyre.BananaForScale

IOS version is coming in the future. 

If you have any requests regarding more features hit me up.

Sure Marketing is sophisticated enough these days that it can engineer Demand, where it is low or non existent.....if your starting point is a decent product. 

And the original iphones were great products. Way better than what passed for a phone in those day. The Demand Engineers were able to coast off that. Add to that, the top quality Financial Engineering (tax/labor cost/exchange rate/interest rate/govt subsidy arbitrage/supply chain optimization) that Tim Cook represents, and they were able to meet and boost Demand, no technologist or creative type inside Apple ever imagined. 

So we got to see Demand and Financial engineering running at a pace, faster than Technical and Creative innovation. But it was possible only cause the starting point was had a real magical feel too it.

But its hard for these products to replicate that moment. People are already overloaded on magic and novelty. They already have cheap high quality large ass screens. And high quality compute/comms/gaming devices in their pocket. There maybe even some level of serious gadget/content fatigue setting in.

0v3r_cl0ck3d,"For certain tasks Apple's hardware is significantly better. The Apple Silicon SoCs (M1, M2, M3) all have unified memory, which means that your GPU can access \*all\* of your CPU memory without any performance loss. On Windows if you need to access main system memory from the GPU you have to wait for data to be sent over PCIE which is a big bottle neck if you're doing it frequently.

&#x200B;

My work relies on heavy usage of compute shaders. When I switched from Windows to Mac I got a 10x performance boost in my workflow because I have 64 GB of RAM, which means my GPU has access to 64 GB of VRAM. Having everything in VRAM ready to go massively sped up the software that I use. Although calling it VRAM doesn't really make sense since Apple Silicon doesn't make a distinction between VRAM and RAM. It's just memory that both the CPU and GPU can access simultaneously.

&#x200B;

I can't imagine there are any VR apps that would benefit from this but the Vision Pro does also use Apple Silicon, the exact same chips used in Macs. That is one advantage the Vision Pro has over the Quest 3 since the Quest 3 uses discrete CPU and GPUs with their own memory.

&#x200B;

All this will probably change by the time the Quest 4 comes out though. Qualcom hired most of Apple's engineers after they finished designing the M1 and put them to work on the Snapdragon X SoC. Marketing materials say that it out-performs the M3 so we'll probably see that (or a future generation of it) in future Quest models.","<div class=""md""><p>For certain tasks Apple&#39;s hardware is significantly better.

I don't know if this is necessarily true. A lot of companies take jabs at their competitor. [Nvidia towards AMD](https://www.techjuice.pk/nvidia-ceo-mocks-amds-new-gpu-calling-its-performance-lousy/), Microsoft towards Apple, Mercedes and Jaguar, Path of Exile mocking Diablo and so on.  Nvidia certainly doesn't see themselves in the number 2 position, and it has never been in the number 2 position. Neither is Diablo more successful in the current arpg space versus POE.

>With that video from Meta and with comments said earlier, they are positioning themselves to be the mass market low price choice for folks that can’t afford AVP.

Are they really? Zuck quite literally stated that he felt his product was better, **period**. Although he, and everyone else who looked at the price difference **initially, would automatically assume** that the Vision Pro is the far superior product merely based on the price, which if true, would make the Quest, indeed, the low price good value choice.

However, technically comparing them, **it's not true**. So, the AVP is only an *overpriced* choice at the moment, not something that technologically vastly outpaces the quest, so much that people only turn to the quest because of it's low price.

Note that the Samsung flagship phones **are not the mass market low price choice for folks that can't afford the iphone.** Just as Windows desktops are not the mass market low price choice for folks who ""can't afford a Mac"".

>they just don’t plan to ever compete on raw quality or performance. They’re conceding that to Apple

Again, I don't know if you watched the same video as me. Zuck says his product is better in quality in some metrics. He also mentioned that the eye tracking input was cool and he planned to integrate it into future models, even going as far as to mention neural interfaces.

>There are definitely trade offs and, for folks that have used neither and tries both, they will come away understanding how much nicer the AVP experience is even with the trade offs (indicating Apple’s made the right ones)

That is not what I have been reading regarding the AVP. A lot of people who've tried both do not agree that the experience as a whole is nicer. It just depends on the specific usage case.

For productivity and integration within the Apple product ecosystem it is without a doubt better.  For those who value immersion (FOV, Pixel Smearing, Comfort), the AVP is a strictly worse product. And yes, there are people who value that. It's why products like the very light bigscreen beyond or the pimax 200fov headsets exist at premium price points.

Again, I would agree with you if it's undisputed that the AVP is just better in every way but ""too expensive"" so people settle with the Quest.

However, that's just not true, and there are many reasons why someone would pick a Quest over an AVP, disregarding the price, and the reason is basically **gaming and entertainment purposes**.

The AVP is utterly and completely defeated in this aspect, even if it costs 7 times more. Meta has invested billions into immersive content and first party titles over the last decade, while Apple's ""VR(spatial computing)"" store is pretty barren at the moment. The metaverse, while not that great at the moment, far outstrips anything Apple has to offer in that space currently (basically nothing).

Same reason why many PC consumers with even a small interest in gaming, get windows PCs/laptops and not Mac products.

>Meta stands to make a LOT of money on being “second best AVP”.

They aren't ""second best AVP"". They are completely different in terms of target audience, just like how Apple computers and Windows computers are marketed to users with difference usage needs.

Again, you are completely bamboozled by the premium price point that Apple has set. ""it is so much more expensive, thus it must be better"". This statement simply isn't true in the VR space. The bigscreen beyond is more than 2 times the price of the Quest 3, but it's lens quality and therefore visual fidelity is much worse due to glare, which is a tradeoff they made for the form factor.

The Quest 3 is not cheap because it uses lousier technology. It is cheap because it is very well cost optimized and subsidized to get VR into the hands of the masses, and is even better than headsets like the Vive that cost more.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

Yeah. Nope.

Even on that article, they compare two different ratings. The RTX is tested on Open CL, while the M2 on Metal.

So if we compare metal to metal, its RX570 level GPU at best. And I dont think the headset is running it at the same power rating, as cooling it would be hard.

94746382926,"Ok I did some reading and now I see where the confusion lies. The Apple M2 isn't just one chip but actually a whole lineup. If you search Apple M2 on Wikipedia it shows all the variants.

But basically the Vision Pro uses the base M2 version which is used in smaller form factor devices like the iPads and some of the MacBooks.

There are 3 other chips in that lineup, each more powerful than the one before it. Those are the M2 Pro, M2 Max, and M2 Ultra. The M2 Ultra which is what's referenced in the link you posted is only in their workstations (the Mac Studio and Mac pro). If you double check the link you posted it says the Ultra has 76 GPU cores.

So yeah, that chip specifically does have similar performance to the 4080, but it's also a much bigger and more power hungry chip than the M2 in AVP. In fact it's actually two M2 Max chips connected together which is pretty cool I guess.","<div class=""md""><p>Ok I did some reading and now I see where the confusion lies.

midkay,"That’s part of what’s so fantastic about it – it’s actually useful and relevant to your daily life.

I only ever pick up a Quest when I have some time to kill and want to kill it playing a VR game. That’s pretty niche. 

The Vision Pro, if you’re an Apple user already, integrates with EVERYTHING. Your reminders, notes, email, messages, tabs, bookmarks, photos, purchased movies, music library, your Mac.

So for example, I can go take 3D photos and videos of a birthday using my iPhone, then put on my AVP and they’re already there, waiting to be viewed. Get a text while viewing, look up and tap the notification, and respond right in the headset. Then pull up my Mac display to work in Photoshop with a single tap (on a 20 foot screen). Do all of that alongside my music library and playlists hovering open in midair right next to it. FaceTime someone and see what they’re doing. They share their view and I’m watching them play an AR game. Pin that up on the wall next to me while I check a new email that just came in. Add some things to my shopping list, which are immediately synced to my phone. So you never have to take the headset off to do anything on your phone or PC, and when you do take it off and head out, everything you’ve done is already up to date on your other devices and it’s all with you wherever you go. I’ve been doing all of this and more daily.","<div class=""md""><p>That’s part of what’s so fantastic about it – it’s actually useful and relevant to your daily life.</p>

sepease,"You’d need to send all the data from multiple cameras and sensors down to the CPU, process them, then dual 4K+ streams back up to the headset, without any latency or loss. All uncompressed. So you’d need at least two USB4 links for the data going up/down, plus a third for the developer strap.

I’m not even sure if the base M2 chip has three USB4 transceivers.

Plus you’ve got the CPU in somebody’s pocket up against their 95 degree body, with essentially no airflow.

If more sensors are added or the CPU is upgraded, the battery, cable, and the headset needs to be reworked.

And if somebody’s battery pack gets damaged due to the excessive heat, it’s a nominally ~$1000 part instead of $200.

And ultimately the overall heat/power consumption is probably significantly more because you need to drive multiple video streams up and down the entire length of the cable plus add components to demux the signal out to the individual components in the headset. Driving multiple additional data clocks at GHz a second, with all the additional RF shielding and cable weight that entails.","<div class=""md""><p>You’d need to send all the data from multiple cameras and sensors down to the CPU, process them, then dual 4K+ streams back up to the headset, without any latency or loss.

Absolutely! So the data is taken from ARCore and fed to a system that puts it in the form of signed distance functions, so it's basically a big set of voxels that describe where the surface lies on the environment that is being scanned. The system can then iterate over voxels to resolve a mesh using a technique known as marching cubes.

Because ARCore data is just based off of feature points in your devices camera feed, I'm doing some other bits and pieces to estimate what the surface is in areas of lower detail","<div class=""md""><p>Thank you :) </p>

chiko28,"Suggestions: since its AR, cant we use scanner apps to scan the house and automate the setup where the game will play around the sidewall that the camera and projector is set to? Instead of placing the obstacles/obstructions to play the game?
The setup is good, but the time will be consumed by setting it up. What if you mistakenly bump the projector, then the placement will be slightly different right?
Also cant we use mobile like a window instead of projecting? A game jumping on your house is cool. Like scan the house and the game automatically know the items. Then play with ease while turning 360 with your phone and game is still set. 
But all in all this is great start😁 goodluck 👍","<div class=""md""><p>Suggestions: since its AR, cant we use scanner apps to scan the house and automate the setup where the game will play around the sidewall that the camera and projector is set to?

BMcFrizzle,"This is really neat! Reminds me of those cool floor-based interactive stuff I've seen in stores before, with things like ponds projected on the floor where you walk and the water moves or balls you can kick, etc. Those use some form of depth sensing, though.

I know someone mentioned doing 3D scans of your room/house as input into the game setup -- I really think you should look into this. There are apps for both iOS and Android that you might be able to use, or look at some of the open source stuff out there. Even Epic Games recently released their Reality Capture app for free use on iOS. Our phones have become super powerful in the computer vision area so you should exploit that if you can.

I've dabbled with some of the mesh generation stuff myself using Unity's AR Foundation, so if you want to chat just PM me.

As this is a custom neural network, what is your issue with porting it to Android or you are relying on Apple ML framework? Another question is do you plan to integrate any monetization in your app or it is used more for promotion of your company? You designed and trained very robust 2d hand pose (as I remember) detection neural network, obviously you will use it for your other projects, are there any chance you will share this technology like selling a unity package or some other way? </p>

The Lume Pad behaves in the same manner as the ""magical book"" from OP's video: Users can see centimeters of content below and above the screen.

So, no AR is used, and the technology is very close to the holographic displays we're seeing in Sci Fi movies.

For example, on a 6-sided cube, one user will see the red face, and another the yellow face.

Eugregoria,"I feel like ""unknowing NPC"" is a slippery ethical slope. Sure, no one is really harmed by this little ball physics test. But the tech industry in general has a problem with the ""it's easier to ask forgiveness than ask permission"" mentality of pervasive intrusive boundary violations. A lot of things in the tech world are opt-out rather than opt-in, with a lot of friction around the opt-out, and even when things like GDPR try to clumsily address that, tech just stacks the deck--it's exhausting to go through your cookie consent *each and every time*, so of course people just say, ""fine, put whatever cookies you want on my computer, I don't care"" even though actually, they don't like it, they don't enjoy being tracked, and they resent the intrusion. This kind of attitude of just perpetually stepping on people's toes but being careful to keep it so that stopping you would be more costly than just letting it happen is behind a lot of the ethics problems in tech. They don't ask, they just take, and go ""what are you going to do about it?"" I mean, Google couldn't exist if it didn't just scrape the web, save people's data without permission, and index it.

Even just the matter of getting some benefit out of their existence and presence (elements in gameplay, images for a video) without giving anything back to them is dubious. If you'd asked every person if they wanted to be part of this test, would they all have agreed? It's not illegal in general to film or photograph people in public places. And yet, when a stranger asks to take my picture, I usually say no. Technically they could have just done it without asking, and I couldn't have done anything about it--I very possibly would never have even known. But ""I could have just taken it, aren't I generous for asking?"" does not obligate me to give consent.

I mean maybe the specific people in this video *did* consent, but it's still being presented as the idea of being able to do this with people who did not consent. It's probably legal, but it's dubiously ethical, and it isn't really respectful. It's no worse than a lot of the other toe-stepping boundary violations we tolerate on a daily basis, but everyone else doing it doesn't make it better.

Being a new technology, we don't even know what the future applications might be. Add in a little ""deepfake"" and you could simulate a view where everyone is naked, without their knowledge or consent. It wouldn't really be *their* naked bodies, just an AI guesstimate of what their naked bodies might look like. But once the idea that people's images can be used and manipulated without permission or awareness in public spaces is normalized, that opens the door to more creepy applications. But going out of your way to respect consent sometimes means giving something up you could have easily enjoyed without any consequences, and it's easy to be selfish and entitled and just try to take what you want until someone stops you. That's what most of the tech industry is doing now, and that's why they aren't liked or trusted. It's the entire culture and business model.

BeYourOwnRobot,"Thanks Eugregoria for your response! It's exactly the type of talk I hope to read when I post things like this on Reddit. Recording and oosting and sharing what I saw with my (digital) eyes is actually part of the discussion this project invokes. I think I agree with you that posting clips online should not be without permission of people in the picture. That said, it's going to be difficult when we enter the age of AR and when we start looking up from our phones that currently attract our attention with an endless stream of images to swipe through. Soon we'll be looking at the world around us again! And it will be a programmable mixed reality environment where you can create whatever you want to create! I hope enough people will grab that freedom. Or at least I hope people will claim their freedom to decide which apps are allowed to define the semi-digital world they're in. 

Conscious decisions is what counts here. We don't want to be passively using whatever Big Tech deems acceptable for our society. It should be -us- defining how we want to deal with each other in the AR reality of the future. 

For that reason I'm creating these experiments. No purpose driven gameplay yet, just a showcase of a way of creating games involving random passersby. In this example, they're partly visible and partly covered with a wireframe. But I've also created sample projects with people fully transformed in an unrecognizable mesh. With current technology it's not yet possible to hide hundreds of people in real-time, but as tracking will improve (and it will in some years) then every person appearing in your augmented vision could be rendered with a mask or mesh. 

For me, using other people as NPCs in my game is not a path towards fully ignoring all the ethics and moving the boundary step by step towards ""anything is acceptable because nothing can be blocked technically"". It's the opposite. I'm trying to find out where the boundaries are. Because if we know those, we know what we don't want. And what we don't want others to do. But we also can be confident knowing what is acceptable. And let's hope we can be free to a certain extent to use make use of these new possibilities. They're great! It would be a bit sad to avoid absolutely anything in this domain because possibly, with a few steps into the wrong direction, things can go wrong.

I hope the above explanation sketches my position in this. And I appreciate very much you sharing your throughts. Because even when not wearing AR glasses ourselves, we'll be in someone elses' mixed reality. So this is about the future we will all live in, and that means that we should all be involved in the thinking process. Creators, users, bussiness folks, ethics experts, politicians, philosophers, citizens. My contribution to that dialogue are these prototype to be able to talk about these future/present scenarios in a hands-on way.","<div class=""md""><p>Thanks Eugregoria for your response!

Eugregoria,"I dunno--I obviously use Google Search constantly, and I don't even know what the internet would be without search engines. I actually remember the days of curated web portals, and that definitely wasn't scaleable. And yet their scraping and copying of data was arguably a copyright violation and an intrusion. Having a copy of people's data that the original posters of the data can't access or delete does sometimes cause problems--google's cache does conflict with the ""right to be forgotten"" in some cases.

But honestly a lot of the time I tend to lean towards, ""just because we can, doesn't mean we should."" Why does AR have to interact with nonconsenting people? Couldn't the same physics just work for people who'd downloaded the same game, who voluntarily opted in? I mean, I play Pokemon Go, and that's a form of AR, but the Bulbasaur I'm catching isn't interacting with anyone who didn't choose to be part of the game. And even Pokemon Go has ethical problems--the Wayfarer project is both kind of labor exploitation (it takes a lot of valuable labor in mapping, photographing, and describing the real world, while paying literally $0 for it) and can involve things like pictures of and inclusion of businesses without the business owner's consent. Yes, if the business owner finds out that all these weird people are malingering in front of their building because their business is now a gym and people are raiding pokemon at it, they can request for Niantic to remove it, but this is, again, ""ask forgiveness, not permission."" Do what you want, and only stop if people mind.

I'm not always ethical myself. Sometimes I'm selfish and entitled, and sometimes I betray my own principles. I've contributed to Wayfarer even though I feel it's exploitation, and I've photographed things to include in Wayfarer that I thought other people might mind if they knew what I was doing. (Such as a tennis court in a condo complex I don't live in, where the people who actually live in the condo complex probably wouldn't have agreed if I'd asked.) And that's a disrespectful, consent-violating way to go about things. I wanted something for myself, selfishly, and I didn't give a damn about their consent. The design of the game encouraged and enabled that way of thinking, but I knew it and chose to go along with it anyway. I'm not making some kind of argument that you're a bad person and I'm a good one. Tech has moved along at a breakneck speed, and we're all kind of culpable.

I think maybe we know where the boundaries are though, but we don't want to hear it. I knew when I photographed and submitted that tennis court that if I'd asked, someone who lived there might have minded. There's a local business I'm thinking of submitting--I could ask the owners, but they might say no. The fact that I know they might say no ethically means I should either ask and abide by their answer, or just not do it. I am not oppressed by not adding more pokestops. I don't need to do this. But it's fun, isn't it? You can have a lot of fun if you just take what you want and disregard the consent and boundaries of others. So it's very tempting. And we don't want to engage with the thorniness of that. We don't want to think that we might be the bad guys.

I don't think you are bravely finding the boundaries either. I think if you really wanted to find the boundaries, you would ask people. But then people might say no, and you might find a boundary you don't like, a boundary that means you can't do a fun thing you want to do. But if you just do it, people might accept it even though it makes them uncomfortable and unhappy, and then you've made a new boundary, one that carves some territory out of theirs and makes more room for you. And that's what tech currently encourages us to do, by its culture.

Is it worth it to have more AR? We don't even know what AR will do for us. Maybe it'll be great. Maybe it'll make our lives worse. Maybe it'll really just be the same old same old with some new bells and whistles. Whether tech has made our lives better or worse in general is a thorny question--even something more specific, like whether Facebook has made our lives better or worse, doesn't have an easy answer. Stuff like antibiotics and refrigeration definitely made our lives better, but a lot of the stuff in development now seems a lot more ambiguous. AI sometimes makes things faster, easier, and more efficient, but sometimes it reinforces patterns of discrimination and treats human beings as disposable for unfair reasons.

There just seems to be a sense of, ""well, this is probably impossible to do ethically, and if I don't do it someone else will anyway, so I'm just going to do it and see what happens."" Even the factor of AR requiring video, itself, can be iffy. We accept a lot of video recording intrusions into our lives, and I don't think we should. I think a lot of security cameras create a police state, and honestly, those doorbell cameras that capture nonconsenting strangers on the sidewalk should be banned. (People should be able to film their own front steps, but not constantly monitor public property--especially when that data is going straight into big tech AI training, again, without consent.) A lot of these forms of data collection also make *a lot of money*, without the creators of that data seeing a dime for their trouble, and that feels like exploitation. I don't like that I can be used to train an AI and not even get a penny for my labor. Stuff that's in the public, like this Reddit comment, is often scraped by bots and used for AI training, without my consent--and I don't want them to do that, but my only recourse is ""don't talk to people in public,"" which is no option at all. I have no means of opting out.

At times I've commented in completely anonymous spaces (not pseudonymous like Reddit) and had my words quoted in articles. The writers of those articles got paid, and they used my content without permission, and I did not get paid. They were essentially making money on my back. When a journalist asked to use my Reddit comment for an article, I said ""only if you pay me a cut,"" and got a lot of outrage. People don't like hearing that their behavior is exploitative and unethical, but most of our behavior is. If there's a financial benefit to some kind of AR NPCs, what do the ""NPCs"" make? Not only is nonawareness and nonconsent an issue, but there's a potential to be making money for someone else while not making money yourself. The faces of homeless people caught on camera are fed into AI training as part of Big Data, and their very existence makes the rich richer without any compensation for their participation. There's ultimately a structural problem in not compensating people for any participation that generates wealth. I doubt you made any money on this test, but if and when AR gets big, there *will* be money in it, and these inequalities will be reinforced.","<div class=""md""><p>I dunno--I obviously use Google Search constantly, and I don&#39;t even know what the internet would be without search engines. I actually remember the days of curated web portals, and that definitely wasn&#39;t scaleable. And yet their scraping and copying of data was arguably a copyright violation and an intrusion. Having a copy of people&#39;s data that the original posters of the data can&#39;t access or delete does sometimes cause problems--google&#39;s cache does conflict with the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; in some cases.</p>

<p>But honestly a lot of the time I tend to lean towards, &quot;just because we can, doesn&#39;t mean we should.&quot; Why does AR have to interact with nonconsenting people? Couldn&#39;t the same physics just work for people who&#39;d downloaded the same game, who voluntarily opted in? I mean, I play Pokemon Go, and that&#39;s a form of AR, but the Bulbasaur I&#39;m catching isn&#39;t interacting with anyone who didn&#39;t choose to be part of the game. And even Pokemon Go has ethical problems--the Wayfarer project is both kind of labor exploitation (it takes a lot of valuable labor in mapping, photographing, and describing the real world, while paying literally $0 for it) and can involve things like pictures of and inclusion of businesses without the business owner&#39;s consent. Yes, if the business owner finds out that all these weird people are malingering in front of their building because their business is now a gym and people are raiding pokemon at it, they can request for Niantic to remove it, but this is, again, &quot;ask forgiveness, not permission.&quot; Do what you want, and only stop if people mind.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not always ethical myself. Sometimes I&#39;m selfish and entitled, and sometimes I betray my own principles. I&#39;ve contributed to Wayfarer even though I feel it&#39;s exploitation, and I&#39;ve photographed things to include in Wayfarer that I thought other people might mind if they knew what I was doing. (Such as a tennis court in a condo complex I don&#39;t live in, where the people who actually live in the condo complex probably wouldn&#39;t have agreed if I&#39;d asked.) And that&#39;s a disrespectful, consent-violating way to go about things. I wanted something for myself, selfishly, and I didn&#39;t give a damn about their consent. The design of the game encouraged and enabled that way of thinking, but I knew it and chose to go along with it anyway. I&#39;m not making some kind of argument that you&#39;re a bad person and I&#39;m a good one. Tech has moved along at a breakneck speed, and we&#39;re all kind of culpable.</p>

<p>I think maybe we know where the boundaries are though, but we don&#39;t want to hear it. I knew when I photographed and submitted that tennis court that if I&#39;d asked, someone who lived there might have minded. There&#39;s a local business I&#39;m thinking of submitting--I could ask the owners, but they might say no. The fact that I know they might say no ethically means I should either ask and abide by their answer, or just not do it. I am not oppressed by not adding more pokestops. I don&#39;t need to do this. But it&#39;s fun, isn&#39;t it? You can have a lot of fun if you just take what you want and disregard the consent and boundaries of others. So it&#39;s very tempting. And we don&#39;t want to engage with the thorniness of that. We don&#39;t want to think that we might be the bad guys.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you are bravely finding the boundaries either. I think if you really wanted to find the boundaries, you would ask people. But then people might say no, and you might find a boundary you don&#39;t like, a boundary that means you can&#39;t do a fun thing you want to do. But if you just do it, people might accept it even though it makes them uncomfortable and unhappy, and then you&#39;ve made a new boundary, one that carves some territory out of theirs and makes more room for you. And that&#39;s what tech currently encourages us to do, by its culture.</p>

<p>Is it worth it to have more AR? We don&#39;t even know what AR will do for us. Maybe it&#39;ll be great. Maybe it&#39;ll make our lives worse. Maybe it&#39;ll really just be the same old same old with some new bells and whistles. Whether tech has made our lives better or worse in general is a thorny question--even something more specific, like whether Facebook has made our lives better or worse, doesn&#39;t have an easy answer. Stuff like antibiotics and refrigeration definitely made our lives better, but a lot of the stuff in development now seems a lot more ambiguous. AI sometimes makes things faster, easier, and more efficient, but sometimes it reinforces patterns of discrimination and treats human beings as disposable for unfair reasons.</p>

<p>There just seems to be a sense of, &quot;well, this is probably impossible to do ethically, and if I don&#39;t do it someone else will anyway, so I&#39;m just going to do it and see what happens.&quot; Even the factor of AR requiring video, itself, can be iffy. We accept a lot of video recording intrusions into our lives, and I don&#39;t think we should. I think a lot of security cameras create a police state, and honestly, those doorbell cameras that capture nonconsenting strangers on the sidewalk should be banned.

hartraft84,"Hi Peglamo, thanks for your viewpoints.

I'm indeed comparing Wintor for a specific use case with 8thwall, the leader in AR. If you want to code an AR app yourself, you should go for 8th wall. However, if you want to easily create and publish an Augmented Reality Tour within 1 hour, you can better choose Wintor.

Regarding pricing: Let's say you want to create a castle AR tour for 1 year with Wintor. This will indeed be 3.500,- euro. However, if you use 8th wall it will cost you $1.188 +  the commercial license to use it of $27.000,-  for 1 year with the discount. 1 month will cost you $3.000,-  On top of that, you will have to spend days/weeks coding to create your own tour app. So total cost of ownership is quite substantial if you go beyond a hobby project. 

Wintor is a good solution for agencies & creatives wanting to focus their time on creating stories & content. Or for the 99,99% of people in the world who cannot code in Unity but do want to create an AR tour..

IMMcClerin,"Glad to hear it! Thanks for supporting Sutu! He's a pretty fantastic leader in this space.

I will say that EyeJack handles far plane viewing very well. Their update function allows you to walk pretty far away after recognizing a target. ARFoundation's ""TrackingLimited"" function performs a little hollow at this stage.  I also like that EyeJack handles GIFs easily.

However, EyeJack currently can only recognize an image. ARFoundations allows you access to Unity's infinite number of possibilities and unique functions around lighting, gaze or touch inputs, and whole entire scenes. For that reason, I am more interested in the game design elements that ARFoundations can offer. So while it started off as saving money, it's grown into understanding how to build tiny worlds that perform under certain conditions.","<div class=""md""><p>Glad to hear it!

A couple of other options in this thread that were shared was MindAR (which their tracking is smooth but  updates sluggishly).

>It is the current progress I have so far on the marker-less tracking setup I've been playing with for almost a year. No markers, no mocap cameras, no suit, no keyframing. This take uses 3 DSLR cameras, though, and pretty far from being real-time. It still has some glitches in poses from time to time, which can be easily fixed with some manual keyframed clean up, but I kept it as it is for the demo purpose.  
Under the hood, it uses #OpenPose ML-network for 2d tracking of joints on each camera, and then custom Houdini setup for triangulating the results into 3d, stabilizing it and driving the rig (volumes, CHOPs, #kinefx, FEM - you name it :)

Jule679,"Wow, that looks both beautiful and very useful for the future when AR will form a bigger part of our lives! I love the idea that you use the same marker for more that one AR model and use the app to change the model that you want to see. I also love that you update the virtual material that is provided through the app for free.

For a little context: I am a researcher/PhD student researching how AR can be used to support learning. I can already see how in the future, when learners want to view a 3D model of an object they are learning about, they just search for it on the web, scan a bracelet like yours, and then the model appears on top of it and can be viewed from different perspectives by moving the bracelet. I mean, Google already has AR models integrated in some of their search results, but for easier interaction, I think to link the model to a universal marker would even be better for a lot of use cases!

Do you plan on adding the possibility for buyers/users to upload their own models into the app, so that those can be shown with help of the bracelet?

I would love to get into contact with you, maybe we can find some interesting ways to collaborate concerning the educational use of your jewelry!","<div class=""md""><p>Wow, that looks both beautiful and very useful for the future when AR will form a bigger part of our lives!

zshift,"Detecting mirrors in AR is \_hard\_. Think about the fact that babies and pretty much all animals don't understand how mirrors work. Then you have to build an AI model that can detect and understand mirrors that's essentially ""smarter"" than them. 

As people, we learn how mirrors work by having an understanding of the ""self"". We move our hands, and we see the same thing happen in the mirror. After a bit, it clicks. But AR devices don't have a sense of ""self"". Let's try to build one. 

Let's say your app targets just iPhones. You could build a physical model of the phone and train an AI on reflections of that model to detect ""reflections"". But that can fall apart as soon as someone puts a case on the phone. Some cases even have weird shapes, and the lighting for these can change over time. And the owner can change cases at random intervals, to add to the complexity. Then add in the complexity to support every possible phone. Not to mention people holding their phones differently, since parts of a hand will always obstruct the full view of the phone. And pop sockets, or whatever else you can stick to the back of a phone. I can't even begin to think about those cases filled with liquid and glitter.

All that fails in this shot, because the phone's reflection isn't in-frame. How do you differentiate between a mirror and a window to another room? or a gap between a kitchen and living room (eg, [https://www.gapinteriors.com/images/LargeWebPreview/0064/0064635.jpg](https://www.gapinteriors.com/images/LargeWebPreview/0064/0064635.jpg))? 

Then we take a look at AR headsets. How do you know what the person wearing you looks like ? That changes potentially multiple times a day, or at least once a day. Facial hair, getting haircuts and styling it, even changing color. It all makes the AI model of the ""self"" incredibly complex. 

What about advanced sensors? Glass gets messy because of this. In the visible-light spectrum, AI can get confused between reflections on the glass and items behind the glass. Adding in IR sensors makes it tricky, because different types of glass behave differently to heat ([https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/74638/transmittance-of-glass](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/74638/transmittance-of-glass)).

Suffice it to say, whoever figures this out is going to make a \_lot\_ of money. Applications would be huge. Imagine clothing stores where you can try on clothes super-imposed over your reflection, or interactions like the one above, which help breakdown the uncanny valley.","<div class=""md""><p>Detecting mirrors in AR is _hard_.

Maybe a few iterations down the line when I'm working with untethered AR glasses and the physical laptop features are properly streamlined/wholly virtual I'd be OK with it, but as it stands it's just big screen space, adding to the horror of screen clutter and poor focus.

From the video, I doubt that the quality of the AR is quite this good if the optics are properly see-through.

* Can simulate a multi-desktop environment when away from home or the office, which may enhance productivity for users used to multi-monitor setups.
* Could open up some interesting gaming experiences, especially since you could eliminate gaps between monitors that exist in a multi-monitor setup.
* Great for privacy, where you don't want someone looking over your shoulder. I could see this being popular in the spycraft... or at least movie-style spycraft.

But I don't think it would replace multi-monitor desktop computers. The glasses might be good for a couple of hours, but might not be comfortable if you are working at your desk for 8 hours.

Especially if there were some arrows near your hands telling you exactly where to move them and how far in order to catch the next incoming ball. I&#39;m amazed, this is fantastic!! Thank you!</p>

You're spot on. Yes, there is performance degrade in some cases and my analysis is

High Vertex count/High Polygon count models (as you rightly pointed out), along with ""Lighting"" constraints (which I'm using to cast shadows) are contributing to a lot of computing for each frame render. I've started looking into using Blender to reduce polygon count without losing much quality.","<div class=""md""><p>Thank you so much.</p>

HistorianNo5068,"Thank you so much for your kind and encouraging words. Really appreciate it.

Very good suggestions, my thoughts:

1) Snap the 3D object placement to most probably place. Currently, the process is indeed manual, and one has to align the object's placement if multiple of them are needed in the design to be arranged in a specific pattern. I'll certainly look into it. e.g. app could predict where the next panel might go. (I'm expecting some use of computer vision/image processing needed to achieve this.) Am I on right track with respect to your suggestion?

2) Making plants a bit more dynamic - I've come across animated plants - and as you said, it will add some ""liveliness"" to the design.","<div class=""md""><p>Thank you so much for your kind and encouraging words. Really appreciate it.</p>

Wavewash,"Speaking from a technical standpoint ( not experiential) - the system is handling rather well, right? When trying to position and track without visual cues the device has to rely solely on accelerometer and gyroscope which has effect of runaway error when not able to anchor to ground truth via visual SLAM.

When you take your hand off the camera and chase the model - you're looking at parts of the room that the system hasn't mapped yet. It takes a moment to retarget the space and do a bundle adjustment to connect with the existing positional data.

ARKit provides you with errors that you can display to help the user help the system target. Here's a short video with my app showing the change in tracking state with fading in suggestion text:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-Br19UZn84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-Br19UZn84)

Hot Lava is a cool idea that would work better on headsets, Shapr3D lied as it could be done on literally any device with meshing including cheap Android tablets and Chrome slates, Complete Anatomy can easily be done using Kinect (gives better results), and Ikea Place is a cool idea but doesn't require meshing at all. I still don't see a reason the iPad is so great when all the features here could be replicated with a Kinect or a $300 chrome slate... 

Oh yeah, and ARCore's meshing seemed faster than the iPad's LiDAR from Shapr3D, as seen here: [https://youtu.be/1q0-jdknbTs](https://youtu.be/1q0-jdknbTs). This is running on a monocular camera. Plus, the technology of their ""LiDAR"" is a pulsed light ToF as opposed to the traditional phased light ToF.

I still don&#39;t see a reason the iPad is so great when all the features here could be replicated with a Kinect or a $300 chrome slate... </p>

<p>Oh yeah, and ARCore&#39;s meshing seemed faster than the iPad&#39;s LiDAR from Shapr3D, as seen here: <a href=""https://youtu.be/1q0-jdknbTs"">https://youtu.be/1q0-jdknbTs</a>. This is running on a monocular camera. Plus, the technology of their &quot;LiDAR&quot; is a pulsed light ToF as opposed to the traditional phased light ToF. Regular LiDAR is a laser that is bounced off a surface, however the optics to scan that laser across a scene are near impossible to miniaturize that small with current technology.</p>

They hide the inaccuracies by not showing a mesh, instead showing a colorized depth map, but pay attention to it. For example, the chair on the left has ""glow"" around it as colors smoothly blend from the chair-depth color to the background-depth color. But an accurate depth map should have a hard line with a noticeably different color between the edge of the chair and the floor in the distance, because the depth is quite different. Artifacts like that are all over, everything is smoothly blending into each other.

Its nice to see an objective appraisal of the experience of using AR hardware. So much of it is propaganda designed to hype up investors. The field is never going to produce a real product if nobody acknowledges what really needs improvement.</p>

CuriousVR_dev,"Hi Reddit, crossposting from another subreddit here  
  
I'm quite excited about how nicely my mapper games work with the new AR features . For those who don't know about the project, I'm just a solo dev who has been working on it for about a year and a half. Custom Home Mapper is a collection of tools and minigames that allows you to setup your own huge playspace with multiple room layouts, build a detailed VR home that matches your own space or play minigames like this golf cartridge I'm working on.  
  
While there is nothing mind-blowing about seeing your own home while playing a game like this, it definitely makes people more comfortable when wandering around in kitchens and hallways with a headset on.  
  
This isn't an Applab project, requires dev mode and oculus just made it harder to disable the guardian in firmware v35. Big disclaimer, it's all quite experimental but if you want to check out more about the project you can get info here : www.sidequestvr.com/app/1701/custom-home-mapper","<div class=""md""><p>Hi Reddit, crossposting from another subreddit here</p>

CuriousVR_dev,"Yeah I think the new AR devices are where this program will ultimately find a real home. I've spent the last year basically fighting against the oculus SDK as they degrade functionality, remove key features and often cripple my app with new firmware updates. Non-dev users cant disable guardian, this sucks massively, since my program requires guardian to be off if you want to play in a large space. Freedom of movement is an important part of the AR experience, quest  isn't easy to setup like this. 

In their defense, I get it, I'm doing hacky things with experimental features, and this isn't the kind of program they officially support. They have a priority to build a solid user experience and that's a big part of how VR will grow.  Looking at the upcoming SDK features, I suspect they will probably release their own version of a home mapper before I can even get this thing on Applab.

So yes I'm keen to port to other headsets, and I suspect it will actually be an easier process for devs like me making AR capable suites of programs.","<div class=""md""><p>Yeah I think the new AR devices are where this program will ultimately find a real home.

Another thing you'll notice is they don't make the UI elements hard to look at; they don't put resting animations on them, & particularly not flickering or jittering animations.  The goal of good UI design is to communicate as much as possible with as little as possible, & to be unobtrusive to the core experience.

The design philosophy I see here is that the UI _is_ the core experience.  From a storytelling perspective, you want to enhance the viewer's sense of awe at the cool future tech, but if you imagine this as a real product & a real world, what would be the goal here?

The user wants to fold their clothes in an efficient way, right?  Nobody wants to gamify clothes folding because it's an inherently unpleasant task, but more because it's a task that requires very little concentration, so you can easily watch TV, listen to a podcast, or w/e else.  A gamification like this increases the demand for attention on the clothes folding, so the question is would enhancing folding clothes ever be inherently more enticing than enjoying AR entertainment (imagine an AR form of streaming, for instance, or AR enhanced audiobooks/podcasts) while folding clothes?  To my mind, that answer is no -- or else, if that's what your character prefers, that inherently says something about that character but will probably not be reflected by the world in general.

I could imagine your character simply folding their clothes with a clean AR UI of dots & arrows guiding them as they have some form of entertainment playing in front of them & maybe a news feed & weather app open, especially if it's their morning routine.

I’ve done hundreds of AR pieces for yearbook covers. I’ve learned thru experience (and failure mostly) what people react positively too. 

For this planet piece, a few things could help it:
- planets should be closer to each other so you can see the scale comparisons to start
- perhaps show them growing so there is some timed animation of interest. 
- maybe some text write out showing planet mass or other info like scale percentages

Point is, it needs to have ‘some’ content that creates interest beyond just ‘showing the thing’ in AR space.

This couldn't be further from the truth. ARCore is well known for its Android fragmentation keeping it behind.

""As far as Android AR enabled phones in 2018, there was a jump from [100](https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/23/google-publicly-launches-arcore-1-0-on-13-phones-will-begin-expanding-lens-availability/) million to [250](https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/12/arcore-16-brings-improved-lighting.html) million when it comes to Android ARCore devices. Apple also saw [380](https://uploadvr.com/380-million-iphones-are-arkit-compatible/) million iPhones with ARKit capabilities by the end of last year.""

Devs are also much more on board with ARKit due to a combination of the fragmentation and Apple's stronger marketing of its platform:

""A simple search on commit repositories shows that strong preference for ARKit by today’s developers. Despite the fact that both platforms were announced within a few months of each other, there is about five times more development and three times greater frequency of discussion on ARKit than ARCore.""

DeltaPositionReady,"Yep agreed with these. Looks like a decent enough game and not too much like an asset dump... 

But why is it AR? Is the only benefit of AR here being that you can alter the Camera distance and clipping planes/mask? 

On Google Tango there was an AR HotWheels game that worked like this except there was no bleed in from the outside world. It was more Mixed Reality. 

I am a solo dev and have been successful in this field for the past 4 years (sold 3 apps in this time), so I know this feedback will hurt considering how much effort I know you have put into this to make it run how it does.  

So this is actually a really decent tech demo. It shows you can code, you've got artistic style and you can do AR decently too. 

How hard would it be to do some SLAM/SIFT on your environment and make your bike be able to drive on the walls or the floor?

<p>On Google Tango there was an AR HotWheels game that worked like this except there was no bleed in from the outside world. It was more Mixed Reality. </p>

<p>I am a solo dev and have been successful in this field for the past 4 years (sold 3 apps in this time), so I know this feedback will hurt considering how much effort I know you have put into this to make it run how it does.  </p>

<p>So this is actually a really decent tech demo. It shows you can code, you&#39;ve got artistic style and you can do AR decently too. </p>

<p>How hard would it be to do some SLAM/SIFT on your environment and make your bike be able to drive on the walls or the floor? </p>

<p>That would make this very impressive. Remove the rolling background and replace the scenery into the real world and have your bike navigate around the real world. </p>

AnarAchronist,"Man i wish i had the CS skills but my field is the intersection of social psychology and emerging tech.

At the moment im focusing my research on how the combination of blockchain and AR (coupled with form fitting AR glasses like a more advanced version of North's) will effectively produce a whole new level of politics. 

Itll start with simple apps that allow people to view each other's spatial art, or perhaps allow people to modify their own or other peoples appearances through AR but have the ability to discriminate who sees what. This will supercharge the google bubble phenomena, allowing people to live in completely separate realities and identify ingroup/outgroup members. Semiotics will enter a whole new and complex era, with people trying to understand how artificial signs are superimposed on actual reality and what the effect will be when different people interpret reality in increasingly different ways.

I could imagine an entire blackmarket culture of people leaving information or GPS locations for others to find,  being highly encrypted and visible only to those invited. I.e. just as silk road was quickly built up around blockchain you can imagine people receiving instructions on where to pick up illicit substances. These would be the early adopters any way. Along with porn obviously. 

Eventually a new generation of kids will use it creating a similar culture to memes today. Their parents will have no clue how different their children are perceiving reality. Just look at the emerging Gen Z culture on tiktok.

Psychologists will eventually have to understand how kids are perceiving reality in order to carry out effective treatment.

The positives are huge though. Work places will become decentralised. Coupled with 5G the office can now be anywhere with a stable connection. Virtual meeting rooms will hugely popular and also create 3D social spaces for people who live half way across the world to just hangout.

Eventually youll see the rise of virtual nations with their own economies. Itll probably end the issue over migration and border vontrol but undoubtedly create new tension points.

So much to look forward to.

nowimarobot,"Thanks, sure thing! I made the initial museum in Blender, here is a 3D render of what it looked like: https://i.redd.it/1h9iebvklof61.png

Before importing it into Lens Studio I decimated the objects and removed a lot of the bevel modifiers to reduce the poly count, also I compressed the textures a lot as these were pretty chonky. Since Snapchat only allows 4mb worth of space, I had to do this by quite a bit!

<p>Before importing it into Lens Studio I decimated the objects and removed a lot of the bevel modifiers to reduce the poly count, also I compressed the textures a lot as these were pretty chonky. Since Snapchat only allows 4mb worth of space, I had to do this by quite a bit!

Thanks! The game itself is not better than a regular physics-based racing game. It offers you a ""fresh"" experience, but that also comes with some drawbacks.  
In my opinion:  
\- Racing in real environments with tiny floating ships is really cool. It's like having an RC F-Zero ship (if I had this as a kid it would have made me crazy happy! 😀)  
\- You need to adapt the physics to fit the size of your gameplay and environment. Typically you have to make the overall speed of the game much slower to keep the player within the same area. Otherwise you would play 100 meters away from your stand in a blink of an eye so, adapting the gameplay to confine it to a reduced area in a racing game while still maintaining fun is quite a challenge.  
\- In my opinion, the coolest stuff comes when you imagine new gameplays around you using the basic rules that the game offers, and the editor allows you to create them.  
\- Also, for me, the true augmented reality in nearly all AR games is the camera control, which you don't have in a regular game. If you can gamify the camera control, you have something special. (I'm currently working on something related to camera control that I think is really cool :) )  


I would love to hear your opinions too. I'm trying all the time to make the AR a + for this game so I understand your point about a regular game with a real background that doesn't offer anything new to the player.

Smessu,"Glad that you like it! We are a small startup working on an SDK for multiplatform AR persistance/AR navigation, this experience is mostly our designer experimenting and testing our AR Framework at large scale. As I said above all our experiences are using **Unity + ARfoundation**.

So our process for Marker based experiences is pretty straightforward, we usually start by trying to get a good marker by taking pictures or finding stock pictures at different angles to make sure the image recognition works well (in this case we isolated the painting on the building side). We usually test this on screens and on-site at different times of the day to make sure the experience won't be impacted too much by weather/light.

Once we are sure we can use the image/pattern as a reliable marker our designer positions everything with placeholders (cubes, spheres,... basics shapes) and uses our [AR framework](https://github.com/Neogoma/ar-framework-unity) to setup the basic interactions and make sure of the scale of the 3D objects..

When the scales and interactions are okay, she can start working on the assets (3D models/animations) to replace all the placeholders and adjust accordingly to live tests! Since she is used to the framework the whole process usually doesn't require any help from the developers.

laiktail,"The skeleton hand after the first cool menu thing is definitely Leap Motion - it’s simply the style of the joints/bones of their default demo projects. Since you can track both hands, they would probably have a Unity project set up (or similar) whereby the two hands are tracked, several objects are added on to the side of the left hand (with the buttons acting as “colliders” and therefore undergoing animation motion once touched by the other hand). 

The pull motion is really cool. I’m not sure if this is true, but I vaguely remember Leap Motion SDK being able to recognise pinches (for the pull-out draw). If not, then what you would do is simply put two collider boxes on the ends of the index and thumb fingers, and have some Boolean set to true when three colliders (two fingers + app drawer) meet, with the average of their positional value being the location of where the drawer is. 

I’m not sure how it’s superimposed onto real hands; again, may be a feature of the Leap Motion SDK

BeYourOwnRobot,"You can gradually implement a functionality by thinking what you want. But doing the other way around can be helpful too. First creating what you don't want, and then remove or replace bits and pieces that don't feel good. 

Like mentioned elsewhere in this thread, in some circumstances you don't want to look as a weirdo waving your arms for no reason. Or it can simply be too crowded to do so. Then a more subtle gesture would be best. An eyeblink possibly (Although using that as interface has been patented - so it's no longer freely available, except if you arrange it with a fee to the patent holder)

Perhaps switch to transparent mode automatically when a person is detected? Or when a person is moving towards you? Or any big object nearing you, or you nearing the object? Or would a manual action be safer? A subtle finger pinching? Not recognized visually by the camera, but being performed with having your hands in your pockets, detected by a ring or a muscle detector implant?

But besides those practical considerations, there's still the question: to what extent do you want to keep on watching a silly movie at all times? I've also created this example to question that. By showing it 'for real' , it's easier to imagine what it could mean for our social life in the cities when these features are in our devices and when people start wearing their AR glasses in public space. Which is the next step I'm hoping for. Not because I like a distopian non-social city. I prefer the opposite. I see a lot of benefits living in an AR enhanced society. But it's important we can be all involved in defining about how it should function, look and feel. And facilitating the process of thinking about that, is what I hope to achieve with a lot of my experiments.","<div class=""md""><p>You can gradually implement a functionality by thinking what you want.

It is really cool seeing something that you built interact with the world, but in the end it has no purpose until AR glasses come out.  So as long as you have the mindset that what you are learning will help when AR glasses are widely available, then all is good.  But if you think people are going to be running around behind their phone.... just take a step back.

I hate the fact that I have to pull out my phone when I go to a restaraunt just so I can scan the QR code and see the menu.  I never go back to these places and they are everywhere.  It breaks the experience of going out to eat and forces everyone to be looking at their phones.

Pretty cool thing you have built.  I just hope you can figure out a way to make it so other people enjoy it as much as you do.

Also... is it actually spending time with your kid when most likely all you are focused on is how the code your wrote is working and seeing how you can improve it / figure out bugs?  Just a thought.  It is cool to run around and video tape your kids for the memories later... but most likely you are more focused on the code and not creating memories to be shared at a later date.","<div class=""md""><p>AR was fun learning several years ago.

That said, not everything works better on glasses. Sometimes a phone is more handy. And it's a clear gesture. People see what you're doing. With glasses we have no clue.

Within just a few seconds I can experience a creation on my phone/glasses. So I make a lot of iterations, fixing a lot of bugs. And then when the last 20% of the bugs need to be solved, I risk spending 80% of the time on those. So that's what I do not do.

Your video reminded me of being in Rome (maybe 150 years ago?) with a book that had about 50 pages of pictures of ruins. You would walk around the ruin until your location and orientation matched the picture of the ruin. Then you would flip a clear mylar page over the picture of the ruin that showed you what the building looked like in antiquity before it became a bunch of old rocks in a field. I loved it! 

And now it's on a phone, with an audio guide?

Two questions: 1) Can you place an imported 3D object and walk around it? 2) Can those 3D objects be animated? Transparent? Emmisive? (Think rainbow.)

AR is not far from it, since it ends up being ""how well can it detect your hands / hand gesture in 3D space"".

Right now brick and mortar retail is doing WAY better than predicted. I mean, it's not great but there are winners and losers. The winners have shifted to focusing on strengthening branding with a better customer experience. They pump up the coolness factor as far as they can go. The idea is getting a customer to have an emotional attachment to a brand when they visit a store so they want to tweet, insta, stream, whatever... Then, boom: people order online. You can't do that with 300 stores but you can do that with 20 flagship stores. In fact, it's cheaper without the 280 shit stores.

If people start wearing tech on their face I can garentee AR will immediately be part of a that ""cooler customer experience"". It's inevitable. What is it going to be? That's the billion dollar question.

Arkainan1977,"""But I had one concern: The field of view.

Like Microsoft’s HoloLens, which uses a different sort of technology to create mixed reality, Magic Leap’s Lightwear doesn’t offer you a field of view that matches your eyes. Instead, the Magic Leap creations appear in a field of view that is roughly the shape of a rectangle on its side. Because the view is floating in space, I couldn’t’ measure it, so I did the next best thing: I spent a few minutes holding out first a credit card in front of my face and then my hands to try to be able to describe how big that invisible frame is. The credit card was much too small. I ended up with this: The viewing space is about the size of a VHS tape held in front of you with your arms half extended. It’s much larger than the HoloLens, but it’s still there.""","<div class=""md""><p>&quot;But I had one concern: The field of view.</p>

I can relate to problem you're trying to solve here so I think you're onto something. Often times I would want to quickly find reviews on a cafe before going in, but I typically will move off to the side and out of the way of traffic before quickly googling the place and it's reviews.

AugmentedThinker,"Great question. This is how I see it. 90% of our customers use QR codes - I mean they make sense in so many fucking ways - believe me - and COVID really helped the adoption. 11 years ago, and even 4 years ago it was painful... but now that pretty much any phone has a QR reader in the native camera - boom.  


This idea was not presented to/for ""YOU"" as an individual - it's more about the areas that already use mass NFC on their dime - not yours (well other than the money you are spending perhaps) - especially from a standpoint of security.   


Eventually, the card will be phased out (higher security level that way as well) and you will just tap your phone/watch at the desk and have your key transferred over with wayfinding to your room enabled, access to wifi, GPS and IoT accessed to show wayfinding to your room and amenities, and so much more with just a secure tap. For now, all of that is possible on the phones of today but infrastructure has to be changed for that path of leveraging glasses when they reach a point of consumer adoption at mass scale - and then it will be as simple as tapping your watch and having the glasses show the above stated.    


Then - way down the track - it will be tapping your wrist implant to activate your ocular implant - haha.

>We tackle the problem of estimating flow between two images with large lighting variations. Recent learning-based flow estimation frameworks have shown remarkable performance on image pairs with small displacement and constant illuminations, but cannot work well on cases with large viewpoint change and lighting variations because of the lack of pixel-wise flow annotations for such cases. We observe that via the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques, one can easily estimate relative camera poses between image pairs with large viewpoint change and lighting variations. We propose a novel weakly supervised framework LIFE to train a neural network for estimating accurate lighting-invariant flows between image pairs. Sparse correspondences are conventionally established via feature matching with descriptors encoding local image contents. However, local image contents are inevitably ambiguous and error-prone during the cross-image feature matching process, which hinders downstream tasks. We propose to guide feature matching with the flows predicted by LIFE, which addresses the ambiguous matching by utilizing abundant context information in the image pairs. We show that LIFE outperforms previous flow learning frameworks by large margins in challenging scenarios, consistently improves feature matching, and benefits downstream tasks.

,"Hey thanks for hearing me out :)

> There are many players building metaverses as you have million people building websites. 

I realize the definitions of some of these terms are still malleable but to me the metaverse is analogous to the web - a bunch of people creating separate things that link together with a standard.

Saying that one person is building a metaverse would be like calling, say, Facebook a web. Even though it's a site that does many things it's still just a site and not a web.

I see why you're calling your work here a metaverse because you have multiple separate apps/games that sort of link together via a protocol you've devised and I think that's super cool because it's how I envision the greater metaverse working someday, but following the above definition it's not ""meta"" because it's still one site.

So I wondered if there was a standard you're using or working towards that makes this interoperable with others' work in the same way HTTP and HTML does for the web.

I think you've answered that: Not currently. And that's fine, I don't know what the state of standardization is so I was just wondering.

As an aside, the first time I used Google Earth VR I imagined what it would be like if when you visited a place it could download something like a Javascript applet which could augment the landscape. What you've done here is the closest I've seen to that - props!","<div class=""md""><p>Hey thanks for hearing me out :)</p>

Banana For Scale is now also available on the IOS app store. 

It's a basic AR app for quick banana measurement. 

To celebrate the Apple release, an apple for scale is included.

Basic functionality:

Banana for scale

It uses plane detection for placing the AR banana objects. This means that you sometimes have to move your phone like an idiot in order for it to work. 

Flat surfaces with contrast often work best.

That gave them understanding but then we created a scene that could do many of things in minutes via our WebAR Studio, ShowCAST, that supports iOS with lidar. The creation will also work on Android and iOS devices that don&#39;t have lidar... the segmentation/occlusion effects just wouldn&#39;t work until we release our new build when WebXR rolls out.  </p>

The science behind their glasses seems sound to me (though waiting for Karl Guttag's opinion since he's the AR optics master). And if it was a scam they'd probably have wayyy more hype around them when it seems I'm one of the few people hyped up for it (mostly due to being able to see the optics better than reality because of my fixed focus vision and them having pinholes make the image always in focus).

Having tried their demos I definetly saw where they're going to improve the Gallium and considering they've had multiple instances of companies trying to poach employees or bribe them to reveal Kura's secrets I'd say it's probably real. Given that these are all people who seem to care about ethics it's understandable why they wouldn't sell and would rather build the technology themselves to ensure it's open to all.

Biggest challenges were probably dealing with scale between engine and real-world, as well as tweaking alignment between the marker, the 3d printed base, and the virtual game overlaid on top.  The scale needed to be just right so players could play at their desk and print the marker easily from any printer.

Designing an interface that encouraged players to naturally try and keep the tower in view was also tough, but the game does still work when the tower is out of view.  

I’m studying object detection for the IOS version now, but ultimately the next build will be playable with or without the marker using just surface detection primarily to reduce the friction for people downloading and playing the game.  Not everyone has access to a 3d printer, but a lot of public libraries actually have 3d printers now for people to use!

The capture is straight from the Quest Pro in 2K by 2k format  - I didn't do any special post-production on it.

But I kind of don't agree, that the passthrough is that bad on the Quest Pro - I mean, yes we can all image where it can go (and rumors about Quest 3 and better passthrough quality are intensifying - so lets hope for it :))) - but when you have good content, the mixed reality effect is powerful enough to ""fool your brain"". For example during Track Craft user testing - people never walk through the virtual track and go around - just like the track is really there - they never go through. And when objects fall from the first time from the track to the floor - I always see that ""waaat"" face :)","<div class=""md""><p>Thanks!!</p>

So AR might do valuable service as an excuse -- an excuse to do better.

<p>- It is tiring to lift your arm to do any UI interaction, you will not last 30 minutes with the arms lifted and moving. A touch ring controller on the finger could make it easier.</p>

Once they have completed the design, they can fast-forward to see how the different levels change over time until they create a massively productive canopy climax a decade or two down the road.

I’ve been working on interactive systems since 2015. The Mocap system is part of the lab.

Large screen is pretty good for Exhibitions or public events.
This system can surely interactive with real object, as long as you put some tracking points for rigid body.

1) Pureland AR
2) LEONARDO DA VINCI. VIRGIN OF THE ROCKS.AR

Smessu,"Yeah the tech is good, the effect is awesome... I agree with these points but one thing we should all remember is that all this AR adoption is market-driven and depends heavily on your market.


The main idea I wanted to express is that, if you're an AR Android dev, you actually have a gigantic market compared to a LIDAR-only market (even if it means dealing with some technical constraints people are more likely to accept it).

In the context of a crisis, people don't all have 1500 USD to spend on a fancy phone just to see virtual objects on their screen. Also, many people don't care how fancy your occlusion/real-world interaction is if there's no concrete use case... This is why we see more marker-based interactions working as a business.

This post doesn't actually explain why the Metaverse is a good idea, it just tries to compare it to something completely unrelated. Conversely proving my point. If you want to convince people that the Metaverse is going to be a great thing, show it to them. It will sell itself. But you can't do that because its just hot air.

Will people use VR headsets to interact through the internet? I suppose they might. But there's hasn't been much interest in the idea so far and nothing in all this hype has described where that interest is coming from. Until then, there will be a procession of these posts.

The problem is that there is nothing to &#39;get&#39;, its Second Life with a bunch of meaningless horse-shit marketing babble on top.</p>

<p>This post doesn&#39;t actually explain why the Metaverse is a good idea, it just tries to compare it to something completely unrelated. Conversely proving my point. If you want to convince people that the Metaverse is going to be a great thing, show it to them. It will sell itself. But you can&#39;t do that because its just hot air.</p>

<p>Will people use VR headsets to interact through the internet? I suppose they might. But there&#39;s hasn&#39;t been much interest in the idea so far and nothing in all this hype has described where that interest is coming from. Until then, there will be a procession of these posts. Why not go the whole way and start talking about the NFT-Metaverse driven by blockchain-AI?</p>

Some mild feedback:

* It's not clear to me if you have a specific audience in mind. You say a focus on 'coding' in the title but still many audiences:
   * Experienced vs Inexperienced developers. If with pre-existing experience: experience w/ graphics or no? familiarity with AR and just trying to stay current or jumping in for the first time? 
   * In my opinion if you choose a very specific audience, you'll have content that will be interesting to someone. If you try to hit everyone, it might not be super interesting to anyone.  (I'm an experienced developer w/ some graphics experience who is about to start playing with some AR stuff, and I watched to see if this might help me choose different tools without having to try everything.  For me this video was close but slightly missed the mark because it was technical enough of the exact functionality and tradeoffs when discussing things. It touched on some stuff, but at too high of a level for me to have gained more information.)
* Towards the end of the video there were a lot of cuts/jumps in the audio, I'm guessing you edited some stuff together.  It was fairly distracting. If my guess was correct, I'd suggest re-recording segments like that.

There might not be an issue now, but rather when they become more performant, and, more importantly, used by more users.

 AR.js is really great and it should be grown even further, However, AR.js is not really an alternative to ARCore/ARKit when it comes to powerful features, since they are Marker-Based. As far as I've read they are based on ARToolkit, and it is awesome, but haven't found much use for it in practice yet.

""Magic bucket"" effects, however - where the content is rendered such that it seems to appear *beneath* the board - work great, and hopefully this battle map project will take advantage of that.

mjbvz,"Thanks!

There are two ways I'm detecting surfaces with this particular visualizer.

First I use the raw depth data from the device's LiDAR sensor. This data updates in  realtime but is fairly low resolution (something like 190x240px). I blur it slightly to avoid some pixelation but the result still is fuzzy looking if you only use this data. The LiDAR sensor can also only sense things that are less than 5 meters away

To get more crisp waves, I also use scene reconstruction to create mesh approximations of the world. Scene reconstruction takes a few seconds to start up but it makes the wave effect nicer because we now have per-pixel distance information instead of the low resolution depth map the LiDAR sensor provides

Using these two methods together lets the effect start up instantly and then progressively upgrade the quality as the device captures more info about the scene","<div class=""md""><p>Thanks!</p>

He has a [patreon](https://imgur.com/a/c8jhbdo), and creates [clickbait videos](https://imgur.com/a/PzIvsVa) [(source)](https://np.reddit.com/r/unity_tutorials/comments/9wpwnb/how_much_money_can_you_make_by_making_great_games/) and hastily made tutorials (mostly knockoffs of proper Unity tutorials), sometimes with [shoddy code](https://np.reddit.com/r/augmentedreality/comments/c429xx/placing_tv_screens_in_augmented_reality_can/eryo45b/?context=3) (which he refuses to correct even several months after the errors were reported)... all in order to [monetize himself](https://imgur.com/a/ZC3ATfF) and his channel.  When folks call him out on spamming, he [threatens them](https://imgur.com/a/H3jet1o) [(source)](https://np.reddit.com/r/creativecoding/comments/buewqv/dont_miss_it_procedural_generation_city_with/epc2aki/) and then deletes his posts.  

Lately, he's been getting banned from several subreddits, and has in response created fake versions of those subs (i.e. r/Unity3D_Tutorials instead of the real r/Unity_Tutorials), where he bans anyone who criticizes him.  Please don't fall for this.

Here are some good subreddits for quality Unity3D content:

r/augmentedReality

r/Unity3D

r/Unity_Tutorials

r/UnityCurated (full disclosure, I'm the mod of that sub, which showcases tutorials that have been vetted by professional game developers for quality and accuracy.

CasparDavidDancehall,"I did a similar transition about four years ago, coming from film/theatre into AR. I basically just started doing Unity tutorials in my free time until I felt I knew enough to start making real projects. Proposed a few ideas for random clients, got one of them, and suddenly had a few months to deliver a real app, not having ever done anything like it before. You learn a lot from having a hard deadline for a real client and not really knowing what you're doing.  


I tend to see the AR tool ecosystem as quite similar to a film set:   
\* Unity is your whole set, this is where everything comes together. It's like a theatre stage, it won't do shit unless you put great assets, actors following a good script on it.  
\* The coding is your script writing / project planning. What should happen where and when, and how? (I use C# within Unity.)  
\* The asset creation is your prop / set / costume construction. This doesn't happen on the stage (Unity), but happens in a separate workshop (C4D, photoshop, AE etc.)  
\* ARFoundation/ARkit/ARcore is your audio/video tech, this is what's needed for you to distribute what you see to an audience. Often you don't have to interact too much with the tech inside them, just place them in the right location and make sure they are working.   


For me, my background in film and theatre has been super useful. Anyone can learn to code, but stuff like dramaturgy, narrative, timing, etc is stuff you can only really learn by practice. If you team up with someone with a background in UI/UX, and maybe someone with more of a game development background, then you'll create amazing things.","<div class=""md""><p>I did a similar transition about four years ago, coming from film/theatre into AR.

wellandr,"There is a long answer of most of your questions :) 

To get started : Their are hundred of tools, none are bad or good, it just depend on what feat your needs :) 
If you come from a Web development background, webAR via WebXR is the way. 
If you come from a game developer background, most known game engine have some AR fonctionnality, maybe your favourite one does.
 If you come from a non developer background, there are a lot of code free solutions.
Don't forget the most important, have fun!

In general, reddit is a good place to find news and information, just search for AR communities.

I am a student in a XR (VR and AR) master degree, in class we use Unity (using C#). Here is how it goes :

When we have delimited the project via research and analysis, we Create the 3d assets in softwares like maya, 3dsmax or blender. In parallel, the dev part of the team prototype using primitives as place holders. We tend to use AR foundation as it wrapp both Arcore and Arkit, if you want to program for Ios, you, will need a mac.

AR Foundation can be replaced by vuforia for example, there are a lot of AR tracking solutions that do different things at different prices, you have to, find the one that answer your specific use case  while featting in your budget. 

Unity support 99% of AR hardware soo you are in a good place using it.

For testing unity have a Build&run function, press it will install on the device your app (any Android based hardware should run flawlessly with this I think) and run it for you, so you can test it easely.","<div class=""md""><p>There is a long answer of most of your questions :) </p>

avrorestina,"I'll try my best to answer, since I am still a novice in programming in general, but have done several AR projects (Android only). WARNING: This is going to be long.

1) You can start by watching examples and tutorials on youtube. Something like the channel 'Augmented Startups' would do, albeit a little outdated. Keep in mind that AR is still new and could be considered 'Beta' stage, meaning it will periodically release new things and remove old thing, so sometime old tutorials are either hard to follow, not enough resources or straight up impossible to follow anymore. Or if you are full-pocketed, consider buy the course at Udemy which had more advanced tutorial. Although, I've never tried that so can't comment on it.

2) The scope really depends on the scale of the project. The bigger it is, the harder and longer it will took. If, for example, you wanted to make a scanner that scan a card to show 3D Object, then the scope and workflow is simple enough. In general, it is something like this:

- Gather the information like the target audiences, most used platform, etc.
- Apps planning phase, like the design of the app, functionality, features, platform of choice, etc.
- Get the required resources like the physical image to track, 3D objects to show, sounds etc.
- Begin the work to create prototype, which is just a simple barebone of the apps to show basic functionality and features, especially if you have a client to show the work to. This steps is important, because sometimes big idea can deluded you from reality. So by prototyping, you get the real idea of what would work and what wouldn't. Personally spent most of my time in here.
- If everything's good, test it out on several devices, prefer differend kind of hardware to test out performance and iron out issues. Remember, if it works for you doesn't mean it totally works for everyone else.
- If you managed to make it here in one piece, then you can start making the apps a lot more beautiful. This is where you put out the full fleshed 3D Model, full animations, beautiful UI, performance tweaking and many more.
- Before publishing, test it out once more to several different hardware to ensure nothing gamebreaking is there.

3) I have no exp in Unreal, but from what I can tell, Unity had much more support regarding AR while Unreal is good for VR content. If you use Unity, you have the option to use:

+ ARCore, support both Android and iOS
+ ARKit, the most advanced one, but only for iOS
+ AR Foundation, both Android and iOS
+ Vuforia, both Android and iOS

I would say go with AR Foundation if you use Unity. AR Foundation is Unity's solution to AR. AR Foundation itself doesn't have full AR features, rather as a platform for you to integrate apps to both Android and iOS. AR Foundation requires either ARCore or ARKit to run, because it takes the features from both of them and apply when needed. It is also much simpler to learn and start. I'll tell more if you wanted, since explaining would be long.

4) As for languages, if you use Unity, it defintely gonna be C#. If you go for Unreal, it is C++. You can and definitely will create and import assets from outside of Unity, especially visuals. Blender and Cinema4D integrates well with Unity, so if you already had skills for either of those, then it is a big plus for you. Otherwise like me, someone who fails at art, just download 3D models from outside and get animation from Mixamo website. As for the ratio, in the beginning it is gonna lean more towards coding. After all features implemented, I saw the works more going towards assets creation and implementation.

5) My testing usually done by running the apps directly on the phone I had. I don't use any debugging or software testing apps on my phone, so I really had no say in this one other than I test my apps directly on target device each time I wanted to test.

6) In my opinion, this is a great field to start learning. AR as of right now is still in a little box, but with Apple's Glasses and many more AR and Mixed Reality devices coming in the near future, the industry will need more experts than before. They will also need as much as content creator they can get (which is us btw :) ) bcs if no one made an app for their device, than the device will pretty much be dead. It is the apps developer that will make such device prosper, not the device's creator themselves. Who would by AR glasses that had no extra apps in them? You get the point. As for learning time, it took me a week to produce a little game of moving character around and collect coin in AR, and that comes from a programmer (yes I am still new, but a programmer regardless). I don't release my apps with paid or ads yet, so I can't comment on money being made, but this field is still a splendid gold mine which no big names managed to salvage it totally yet. Well, to speed up the process, consider learn how to make simple 3D games first, because the process and programming is basically the same.

TL;DR : Learn AR tutorials from youtube and start slow and small.

I should probably mention that not every devices can support AR, so consider look at your target audience's device before jumping in.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;ll try my best to answer, since I am still a novice in programming in general, but have done several AR projects (Android only).

<p>4) As for languages, if you use Unity, it defintely gonna be C#. If you go for Unreal, it is C++. You can and definitely will create and import assets from outside of Unity, especially visuals. Blender and Cinema4D integrates well with Unity, so if you already had skills for either of those, then it is a big plus for you. Otherwise like me, someone who fails at art, just download 3D models from outside and get animation from Mixamo website. As for the ratio, in the beginning it is gonna lean more towards coding. After all features implemented, I saw the works more going towards assets creation and implementation.</p>

<p>5) My testing usually done by running the apps directly on the phone I had. I don&#39;t use any debugging or software testing apps on my phone, so I really had no say in this one other than I test my apps directly on target device each time I wanted to test.</p>

<p>6) In my opinion, this is a great field to start learning. AR as of right now is still in a little box, but with Apple&#39;s Glasses and many more AR and Mixed Reality devices coming in the near future, the industry will need more experts than before. They will also need as much as content creator they can get (which is us btw :) ) bcs if no one made an app for their device, than the device will pretty much be dead. It is the apps developer that will make such device prosper, not the device&#39;s creator themselves. Who would by AR glasses that had no extra apps in them? You get the point. As for learning time, it took me a week to produce a little game of moving character around and collect coin in AR, and that comes from a programmer (yes I am still new, but a programmer regardless). I don&#39;t release my apps with paid or ads yet, so I can&#39;t comment on money being made, but this field is still a splendid gold mine which no big names managed to salvage it totally yet. Well, to speed up the process, consider learn how to make simple 3D games first, because the process and programming is basically the same.</p>

<p>TL;DR : Learn AR tutorials from youtube and start slow and small.</p>

<p>I should probably mention that not every devices can support AR, so consider look at your target audience&#39;s device before jumping in.</p>

There are a lot of pretty advanced things you can do with them  especially on Snapchat which just implemented machine learning!
They are very exciting platforms I believe also because they make AR so much more accessible than say Arcore or arkit which are limited in not only number of devices that run them but also by the fact that they have to be discovered and installed as traditional apps.

,"TVs display images. Games are fun. Current AR displays are not great at doing the very thing they exist to do.

I'm not negative about AR - I'm super excited about it and follow it closely - I'm just realistic about where we're at and want people to realize the glasses we all dream about are not right around the corner.

Even Zuck is hedging on it being this decade.

Sure ok, some waveguides will hit the market and a handful of people will buy them (maybe myself included) and that will help pave the way, but those will never bring us the ""iPhone moment"" of AR.","<div class=""md""><p>TVs display images.

,"I completely agree with the utilitarian aspect of having a front-facing camera, especially with depth sensing, and possible multi-cam like the face unlocks and similar to what the Windows Hello eco system uses to unlock desktops.

We've all seen it from shows like Black Mirror where you can scan someone's face, and have it auto-magically search the WWW and scrape all the information about that person's identity through the glasses.  While that's attractive to the wearer, it's unattractive and quite intrusive from folks who AREN'T wearing it or who do NOT WANT to wear it.

Facial recognition, when not used on oneself but used on others, are already getting a ton of backlash.

As much as I like this tech, I believe front-facing camera is going to kill interest in this tech real quick.  Many facial-recognition systems, like Amazon's brick and mortar store that failed, law-enforcement (UK as an example), are getting backlash already.

It's one thing when people take photos and you just happen to be in the background in a public setting, it's another when you are willfully pointing it and focusing on people's faces to extract information.  The latter, people have never liked it, even as early as when films were used in cameras.

P.S. While I love all things AR and VR for MYSELF, I believe the harassment against the Google Glass wearers were justified.  I often have to take my daughter to the restroom with me because she is very young.  If I saw someone wearing a Google Glass in the restroom with me, I'm assuming he/she is filming, and I'm going to assume that he/she is ready to deal with the consequence of filming in a restroom.  Would it be any different if I were holding up my phone like I'm filming something, while I'm in a public restroom?  Not just filming, but this video footage is connected to the internet live, either for analysis, streaming, or both.","<div class=""md""><p>I completely agree with the utilitarian aspect of having a front-facing camera, especially with depth sensing, and possible multi-cam like the face unlocks and similar to what the Windows Hello eco system uses to unlock desktops.</p>

<p>As much as I like this tech, I believe front-facing camera is going to kill interest in this tech real quick.  Many facial-recognition systems, like Amazon&#39;s brick and mortar store that failed, law-enforcement (UK as an example), are getting backlash already.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing when people take photos and you just happen to be in the background in a public setting, it&#39;s another when you are willfully pointing it and focusing on people&#39;s faces to extract information.  The latter, people have never liked it, even as early as when films were used in cameras.</p>

<p>P.S. While I love all things AR and VR for MYSELF, I believe the harassment against the Google Glass wearers were justified.  I often have to take my daughter to the restroom with me because she is very young.  If I saw someone wearing a Google Glass in the restroom with me, I&#39;m assuming he/she is filming, and I&#39;m going to assume that he/she is ready to deal with the consequence of filming in a restroom.  Would it be any different if I were holding up my phone like I&#39;m filming something, while I&#39;m in a public restroom?  Not just filming, but this video footage is connected to the internet live, either for analysis, streaming, or both.</p>

BeYourOwnRobot,"Yes, the on-frame operation needs to be replaced by something else. Some people believe it's going to be voice-control. But I don't think that's suitable for all occasions, assuming we'll be wearing our AR glasses in public spaces or in loud areas. The device will misunderstand your commands. And people in your vicinity too.

Eye tracking technology is amazing to use. If a sophisticated mechanism can decide when an eyeblink means a left or right click, then that would be superb. But it could be ultra frustrating too, when it sometimes misjudges an unintentional eyeblink for a click.

I personally think the smartphone will stick with us, accompanying our AR glasses. A little touchscreen with an eye operated cursor, that would be my choice.

bferns,"I'm using Unity3D's early Tensorflow support https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/ and the approach they use to provide 'observations' (images from a game camera) to provide images from an actual camera.

I then found a pre-trained model trained on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset which recognizes 80 objects and returns rough bounding boxes. I used a Mobilenet SSD net for performance. Finding exactly the right inputs for this was a bit tricky without documentation - a lot of the AI OSS world is still very academic-focused and assumes experience with their tech stacks.

I'm running ARCore/ARKit for the AR tracking and plane detection. Most of the time spent getting this running actually went on placement and scaling (and avoiding placing the same object multiple times, especially as the neural-net switches labels occasionally). I could have  not bothered solving those problems just to make the demo video, but I wanted to see what kind of issues arise as you try to tackle them.

Ditto with performance - I wanted to get it close to realtime, as without the instant visual feedback the sense of magic is lost, even if its technically the same process. I ended up putting the tensorflow interactions on a separate thread and only running the model once every 2 seconds, and parsing the Poly assets over a series of frames (can't be threaded as generating assets must be on the Unity main thread). The TF model I use takes between 400ms and 1000ms to return, which I think can be improved.

Poly have a great API and docs https://developers.google.com/poly/develop/ , I really love what google are doing here, and their focus on stylized almost 'wireframe' 3D rather than realistic 3d, as its very achievable to build a huge, broadly useful library at this quality. They have Unity, Unreal and (most interestingly) web SDKs.

If I have time, I'd very much like to port this whole dumb thing to WebXR (using google cloud automl as the AI component) and use the Poly web API. 

However the main reason I've built this is a testbed for an article I'm writing on how an AR-OS might be structured, and how the UX will work, so I'm trying to focus on that for now! (btw if anyone is interested in reading an early draft of Part 1 and giving their thoughts, I would appreciate it).

<p>However the main reason I&#39;ve built this is a testbed for an article I&#39;m writing on how an AR-OS might be structured, and how the UX will work, so I&#39;m trying to focus on that for now! (btw if anyone is interested in reading an early draft of Part 1 and giving their thoughts, I would appreciate it).</p>

DaringCoder,"I hate these voluntarily misleading ""ar"" marketing videos. This only looks cool because the food models are rendered as seen from the camera perspective. IRL you could not do that without precise head tracking of the user, which I doubt this device has any means of performing. So you'll only get a flat, monoscopic image projected on the table, rendered probably from where a person of average height would have the eyes. Move your head a little, and the illusion (if there even was) would be broken.
The same product, with head tracking capabilities, would be pretty cool and give many usage opportunities.

Maybe even maintenence if you can manage to recognize the orientation of a motherboard (for example) in front of you. If tethered to the phone, indoor localization couls be possible. It will most likely have a smart display with finger tracking to replace taking out your phone. 
$500 is  a price point for either gaming (like VR headsets) or professional use, so it seems like it could have a chance.<br/>

You&#39;re taking design language from traditional game controllers without understanding why they&#39;re there in the first place. VR controllers aren&#39;t game controllers, they&#39;re your virtual hands. VR controllers from the major platforms tried and are trying to find a balance between familiar input paradigms and immersive hand tracking, yours seems more interested in cargo-culting Nintendo and Sony.</p>

erin_corinne_,"I think a big thing to keep in mind is:

How do hands curl around objects to grasp them?

Our hands very rarely end up looking nice and straight and squared off. I think I would expect some of the buttons to be at a bit of an angle, mimicking how a thumb would have to stretch to reach each button. 

A final product that feels really natural and easy will likely have a bit of curve to it, both in the shape of the controllers and with the placement of the buttons.

It may even be worthwhile to look into completely different ways people have historically solved these issues around the human hand. No need to copy them, but it’s good to see inspiration sometimes. [The pistol-style handle of a foil comes to mind in particular.](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Competition-Electric-Fencing-Foil-Youth-size-2-pistol-style-grip-handle-Right-/152538970693)

Yes. As Drew pointed out, VR without the headset. Does it need to be ""real estate"" or can it be any environment created in Blender? If I create an environment in Blender, how would I use it with your app? You use Blender natively or export to FBX or GLB? Are animations possible?

EnvisionVR,"Hey TemerePerito,  
We offer our serviced to any industry, however many of our 'selling tools' in our app cater for unbuilt real estate. While our app can also be downloaded onto the Meta Quest 2 for the most immersive experience, realestate agents love being able to hand someone a 12.9"" ipad pro and let them walk through a listing, or let them do it on their phones.  


You can find info on our end-product on our [website here](https://envisionvr.net/developers/)  


Our current workflow is to use a 3ds Max model for highest fidelity or a sketchup/archicad model for a lower fidelity experience. In the past we started with blender so we do still have the ability to do blender into VR if this is something you are interested in discussing. May I ask what kind of models you are looking to have optimised?","<div class=""md""><p>Hey TemerePerito,<br/>

**How so?**

You need to provide a citation demonstrating this is the case.

There is just so much evidence that Facebook does make money selling personally identifiable data. I don't know how you could claim otherwise in good faith.

Consider the [Cambridge Analytica scandal](https://www.wired.com/amp-stories/cambridge-analytica-explainer/). That entire scandal was about Facebook selectively selling personally identifiable datasets (or at least deliberately offering the means to collect those datasets) to electioneering firms.

Consider the [housing discrimination scandal.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/us/politics/facebook-housing-discrimination.html) Where Facebook allows advertisers to restrict who is able to see ads on the platform based on characteristics like race, religion, and national origin (even where it clearly violates the law).

I provide 2 citations, but I could provide many more examples if need be. There just is no honest way to claim Facebook's practices are not hostile to privacy.

Facebook has a history of making lots of money while blatantly abusing the information they have access to (in a personally targeted manner).

That said, they're probably not delusional. Considering what they've gotten away with so far, combined with an international army of lobbyists and PR people, I'm sure they'll find a way to normalize their mass-surveillance capitalism.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

Perhaps that explains what I&#39;m exploring with my facefilter NFT experiments: how we might dress up our AR selves with NFT items.</p>

But I created a code generating mechanism which creates dynamic codes for the owner of the NFT. With those temporary unique codes, the filter can be unlocked. 

When the owner resells the NFT, he/she can no longer obtain the dynamic codes.

RoyMi6,"One thing they don't explicitly mention is a camera. Having a transparent screen doesn't make it AR - it makes it a floating screen in front of your face wherever you look. Surely to make this isn't AR it needs some kind of  tracking that enables the software to understand what you're looking at in a 3D sense. I mean the UploadVR article even mentions the demo having ""numbers hovering over objects in the real world""  ([https://uploadvr.com/mojo-vision-venturebeat/](https://uploadvr.com/mojo-vision-venturebeat/) ) but (correct me if I'm wrong) that surely isn't possible unless they've just ""dumbly"" positioned the text over a object in a fixed position from a fixed point of view.

I mean, credit to them - if they can create the screen and cram in the computing power into the lens I don't doubt they couldn't do it with a camera too, but it's just not clear that's what's happening at this point.

Also, shame they're going down the ""computer on a lens"" route.

But to your everyday consumer, it probably seems like the tech isn't really doing very much - because right now manufacturers of AR devices are mostly aiming their tech towards more of a business/enterprise audience. Plus, the market is so saturated with several different devices, that one of the problems is, no business that is wanting to dip its toe into AR to enhance their workforce is willing to take a risk on a company that might - as DAQRI has proven - close up shop in a few years.","<div class=""md""><p>In a way, it already has taken off - there are tonnes of AR headsets doing what DAQRI does, aimed at &#39;industrial AR&#39;.

The immersive power of all this has real benefits (read: dollars saved) for businesses. But they need to be convinced to use it. Once people start using it everyday for work type things (similar to email) it’ll eventually take off.

WikiTextBot,"**Xennials**

Xennials (also known as the Oregon Trail Generation and Generation Catalano) is a neologistic term used to describe people born during the Generation X/Millennial cusp years, typically from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. People who identify with Xennials, Oregon Trail Generation or Generation Catalano do so because they do not feel they fit within the typical definitions of Generation X or Millennials.

In 2017, Xennial was included in Merriam-Webster's ""Words We're Watching"" section which discusses new words which are increasingly being used, but which do not yet meet criteria for a dictionary entry.

<p>To promote a good user experience we had to opt to limiting the classification only to things the user pointed to. Some of our most powerful use cases ended up being pulling up wine information, definition of words, and showing the Amazon 1-click purchase button on relevant items when pointed at my the user.</p>

If your brand app is AR-enabled, users will be able to point their mobile camera at QR codes, bar codes, markers, or other objects and see an overlay with whatever you want them to see. Mobile AR is also more budget-friendly than traditional forms of marketing.

One of the simplest applications is flyers, business cards, magazines, or other marketing materials you hand out. AR can make a magazine issue special by adding a dimension to the illustrations.

I live in a land of mushrooms where psilocybin is legal. I guess now I won't have to try some. I have this AR. 

So once again, just make my mushrooms sauteed in butter with onions and top my double bacon cheeseburger with them. And I'll just watch this.

Wait. So how do I get these things on my phone/glasses?

They made the world around you change and the people such as Alex Kipman were right there in front of us as themselves (not avatars) via Holoportation.

The rest of us were standard avatars. The final 360 party scene was pretty impressive in VR enhanced by the fact that Alex Kipman wasn't an avatar but a real person moving around in real time not far from you spatially. We might think of the final light saber battle scene in Vader Immortal with lots of action going on all around you with one big difference: one of the characters in the scene is a real person reacting in real time.

I think the big take away is that they want to make these types of mixed reality experiences available on any platform as developers create new experiences. And via the cloud, an app can place 3D models in your environment - some of them may be anchored and persist over time as if they were real.

immersive-matthew,The Gartner Hype Cycle is a total joke. Look at these 3 hype cycles for emerging tech from 2017 through to 2019.  Love how they thought VR was in the slope of enlightenment in 2017.  What a joke.  As a VR developer I can tell you it is at best just leaving the trough of disillusionment and has another 2-3 years before it is really hitting the slope of enlightenment.  Heck they took it off the 2019 emerging tech entirely. Bizarre given we are all hardly using it yet.  The  Oculus Quest and PlayStation VR are the biggest platforms and they are nothing compared to even consoles and other tech that has emerged.  https://www.renacen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Gartner-Hype-Cycle-for-Emerging-Technologies-2017-2018-2019.jpg,"<div class=""md""><p>The Gartner Hype Cycle is a total joke.

Gartner’s team recently explained that their Hype Cycle intends to be dynamic because of the large scope of technologies that need to be tracked. So, instead of following each step of every innovation’s maturation process, it opens up space for upcoming hypes that appear in every new cycle.

I feel pretty confident to argue that VR right now has gone from only pioneers to early adopters, as I predict that around 3-5 million headsets will be sold the coming year, in which VR is not some fringe tech anymore. So I would say that VR is in the slope of enlightenment right now. 

I would even argue that it's very close to plateau of productivity, maybe just 1-2 years from it. So yeah, Gartner was maybe a bit optimistic, but 2017 + 5 years is 2022, and I think VR might actually reach this plateau by then (I'm thinking at least 10 million headsets per year for it to count as mainstream adoption).","<div class=""md""><p>Interesting points.

TTycho,"Hi r/augmentedreality,

Thought you might appreciate this use case of augmented / mixed reality. I’ve been developing a VR DJ app for the past couple of years and recently added a Mixed Reality mode to the standalone version.

As a DJ it’s super important to be able to see your surrounding and read the crowd while playing, and although the passthrough resolution is still a bit lacking, it’s definitely good enough to get a sense of what’s going on around you.

If anyone has a Quest headset and wants to give the app a spin, it’s available on [Oculus App Lab](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5812678618774066/).

Also more than happy to answer any question about the app or its development!","<div class=""md""><p>Hi <a href=""/r/augmentedreality"">r/augmentedreality</a>,</p>

These are what i think would use it:

* **Body tracking** for VR, pretty obvious, having a phone to do the bodytracking is simple and easy.
* **Kinetic V2** while kinetic can be considered a failure, it was a failure in my opinion simply because it came too early, and it came in a form of ""fixed place camera"", didn't add much, games were limited due consoles and early internet times, and it was not cheap. However, simply setting up a phone to do the tracking would totally get people on it, due to ease of access. Exercise + fun is a good combination.
* **Development Kit** was mentioned already but once again, using this tool, you could allow lot of small companies to make animation pretty easly.

So far there are choice full body tracking solutions for VR in market. These either include using trackers and outside-in tracking or mocap suits. There are few products which use additional hardware for near full body tracking. But nothing as hands free as something like kinect.


There is a WIP solution floating on the net which is similar to yours, but even that uses multiple cameras, as far as I remember ( 1 mobile camera + 1 webcam, or more).

Anyways, really interesting work, good luck with the launch.","<div class=""md""><p>What I had in mind was if your app on my phone could do the body tracking operations and relay the data to the VR app, where we could then implement body tracking to our avatar.</p>

technobaboo,"hello, XR UX dev/designer here!

Eye tracking is very low-dimensional and not as reliable as you'd think, especially for people with any eye problems. Your eyes dart around a TON. Smartphones have the issue of being 3DoF or draining battery with 6DoF, and the need to look at the screen to use any controls since they have no physical buttons to use. They're also not very ergonomic in the hand...

If you want really neat spatial cursors designed by a good friend of mine, check out [https://dofdev.org/](https://dofdev.org/). Those spatial cursors have been tested in XR and many can help with disabilities and are much more general purpose. Not every cursor will work in every scenario! Sometimes a cursor isn't the best.

Overall, I think we'll have eye tracking as a way to augment other methods of interaction. Hand tracking is a very solid base interaction, super accessible just like touch is but not as precise as a controller. Accessories such as smart rings or pens or such as a primary interaction method are easy to lose and bulky and have little dimensionality compared to hands. Controllers for most XR games are a definite necessity, they offer easy buttons and such for actions without needing to look. 6th finger stuff is doable, but it's def a gimmick.","<div class=""md""><p>hello, XR UX dev/designer here!</p>

dzak8383,"Hi,

I thought I will share my setup with augmented reality. I shared few days ago my app and I got a lot of questions how it actually works, so this is a little showcase. On the video I started with default 3D view where I can control devices by look at my house ""map"". Then I synchronized with the augmented reality, using synchronization point that I selected during initial setup. After synchronization, the app loaded all of the devices at the right positions. From here I can walk around the house, switch between 3D and AR view and play with the devices.

Smart devices:

\- SmartThings light switches

\- Hue Lights lamp light

App:

>Abstract: Traditionally, 3D indoor scene reconstruction from posed images happens in two phases: per image depth estimation, followed by depth merging and surface reconstruction. Recently, a family of methods have emerged that perform reconstruction directly in final 3D volumetric feature space. While these methods have shown impressive reconstruction results, they rely on expensive 3D convolutional layers, limiting their application in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we instead go back to the traditional route, and show how focusing on high quality multi-view depth prediction leads to highly accurate 3D reconstructions using simple off-the-shelf depth fusion. We propose a simple state-of-the-art multi-view depth estimator with two main contributions: 1) a carefully-designed 2D CNN which utilizes strong image priors alongside a plane-sweep feature volume and geometric losses, combined with 2) the integration of keyframe and geometric metadata into the cost volume which allows informed depth plane scoring. Our method achieves a significant lead over the current state-of-the-art for depth estimation and close or better for 3D reconstruction on ScanNet and 7-Scenes, yet still allows for online real-time low-memory reconstruction.

Proceedings of ACM CHI 2022.  
TapType is a portable, wireless text entry system that brings touch typing to everyday surfaces. TapType’s two wristbands sense vibrations arising from finger taps, from which our Bayesian classifier estimates finger probabilities. Our text decoder then estimates input character sequences by fusing these predictions with the priors of an n-gram language model given a key-finger mapping. TapType is suitable for several applications, including text entry (a) on a phone or (b) on a tablet using the surrounding surface for increased typing convenience, (c) in conjunction with audio feedback only in mobile scenarios, or (d) in situated Mixed Reality to complement typing with passive haptic feedback.

BeYourOwnRobot,"I'm curious about that remark. Because personally I see the benefit of using NFTs here. For me it's a way to create something and sell it. In this case: an opportunity for art creators to exhibit on a spot within this globally available virtual art exhibition.

But when selling this creation in a classic way, that would mean I would get a fixed price for creating it. But what about maintaining the code? If the NFT mechanism starts working, and this gallery is gaining traction, the sales of the 'ownership NFTs' on the secondary market will mean there's some income for me, after the launch. Which would allow me to keep updating it, improving it.

I think NFTs could be an interesting way of working in the context of software development, which is never finished. There's always new features to think of.

Of course this could also be done in a classic way, with developers and contracts. But if something can be done in one way, would that be a reason to stop exploring new and other ways?

* [ARmedia SDK](http://dev.inglobetechnologies.com/) also has support for CAD model tracking, more info on that [here](http://dev.inglobetechnologies.com/documentation/plugins/start/#creation)

* [Visual Servoing Platform](https://visp.inria.fr/) is a completely open source library has a 3D model tracking module with CAD models. More info [here](https://visp.inria.fr/mbt/)

* [Zumoko](https://www.zumoko.com/solutions/zumoko-cad-dt/) also has CAD model tracking for the Microsoft HoloLens. Not entirely sure about their licensing though.


Those are just a few examples I could find right now. If you go to the spreadsheet there's probably more, look for the ones that have 3D Object Tracking and then just check if they support the other features you need.

Btavangar,"Frame is designed to be light enough, intelligent enough, and have enough battery to set you down a path of weaving AI into your daily life.  The ways this can manifest are extremely diverse across personal/social, productivity, health/safety, memory augmentation…. Personally I love employing AI web search like perplexity to query the places, products, shops, and processes i see on a daily basis to understand more about them from whats available/timely on the live web.  

Good news on battery life: as of latest testing, we get 6 hours continuous use — so with normal anticipated use of 20mins per hour you get ~18hrs of use.  Pretty cool.

I can’t comment on other tools because AVP is so fresh (and different) and other stuff hasn’t really panned out.  So we’re a spectator along with everyone else!","<div class=""md""><p>Frame is designed to be light enough, intelligent enough, and have enough battery to set you down a path of weaving AI into your daily life.

HammerFET,"Yeah there's two ways of doing it really. Frame itself is designed to be low power so doesn't have an application processor similar to what you might find in a phone or SBC. It does however have an FPGA which is directly handling the camera input. FPGA devs could leverage this for custom vision DSP and combine it with the onboard microcontroller to do some very clever things. This would be vert fast and efficient, but the most complex in terms of development.  
  
The other way would be to stream image frames to a phone/PC and make use of the powerful hardware there for vision processing. This would be a lot slower but maybe a better way to get a proof of concept together before diving deeper. There will be more controls on the camera API soon so it should be fairly flexible and hackable.

HammerFET,"Great question :)

One of the biggest challenges was waiting on the super long leadtimes of different parts and assemblies. On firmware, a lot of code had to be written before we had any real hardware. On hardware we had to do the mechanical design before we pinned down the final electronics. And for a long time we couldn't really test the optics because we didn't have the graphics ready. It was a lot of chicken and egg. Often it meant that we had to think ahead of the curve and predict potential problems early. A lot of tasks happening in parallel, where you had to be comfortable to take risks and be ready to change something quickly if it turns out not to work later. All in all, we really had to work as a team and not try to just do things our own way

We did a lot of iterations, but it all came together in the end :)

Regarding your second question, Frame for me sort of takes me back to the early days of computing. It's not at all powerful hardware compared to the phones we carry around in our pocket, but it represents a blank slate where totally new possibilities might exist. Unlike so many devices today, Frame isn't designed to only consume, but also to create. To me at least, that represents the real essence of computing. I hope because of this, folks find new and ways to use Frame in their day to day lives, without being constrained to specific ways of thinking, or be biased by how a company says they should use the product. The user should be free to make anything they like, and quickly the line between consumer and developer might disappear again :)","<div class=""md""><p>Great question :)</p>

I posted this earlier but something was Janky with reddit.

Here is another example of what ""FREE"" looks like on [WorldCAST](https://www.worldcast.io/). I needed to create a fun birthday invite - so I used u/canva and sketchfab which are available inside the platform as our partners. I just left the placeholder info from Canva in place for this vid - but that can all be edited right inside PrintCAST. I used our button creator to make links for the RSVP as well as to go to our ShowCAST SLAM studio as illustrated in the vid to place the dino in reality. They both have sound as well.  
  
Model by LasquetiSpice.  
  
Zero code was used - I created it from beginning to end in under 10 minutes and this shows our parallax/occlusion feature.  
  
There ideally would be a QR code on the print - but not for this quick demo.

We used to play taboo using cards and board games. Then we switched to playing it with our phone. We noticed our chillin was a lot less personal since everyone was looking at their phones. 

The magic of AR enables the following: 
- having access to info that you otherwise wouldn’t when looking through your phone (think price, nutrition, metadata lookup of books, food, think directions, think furniture sizing)
- expressing yourself in creative ways (think snap, memojis) 
- staying heads up (think AR glasses - this is many years away regardless of what PR teams are releasing these days)

Online games cut you off the social aspect of tabletop games. You may be involved in conversations but you don't get the emotional level of social interaction when playing over one table, the gestures, body language and so on. When you play multiplayer AR on the phone, you still share the same physical space, you connect,  objective of the game is your shared ground with players.

This time we’re going to MARS! We’re excited to show you our new AR application created for Smithsonian Channelin collaboration with NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration, that will let you experience the ongoing MARS 2020 mission!

The free MISSION TO MARS AR app brings an innovative way to explore the story, enabling anyone with a smartphone or tablet to bring the rover into their own world, control the first drone to ever fly on a different planet, and even step through a portal onto the surface of Mars. This is our second space project developed with the amazing team at Smithsonian after the Emmy nominated APOLLO’S MOON SHOT AR.

Just check it out!

HowToGOTY,"I’m definitely an AR enthusiast but I think you’re right on this point. It’s sad to see that we didn’t move on from that point to find and demonstrate an impactful use for AR, which you can really use on a regular basis.

That said, I think we still have plenty of reasons to be optimistic for AR and Apple:
- the LidAR sensor will bring a way more sensitive + quick to enable device which might enable some usage which were still not ready at that point
- I think they might be keeping some big announcements in this field for WWDC which is focused on software + september on the release of the next iPhone, which will have a LidAR sensor and will be well more distributed than the high-end iPad Pro.
- of course, if there is an headset coming, it would solve all the basic problems of syncing your arms and eyes to stay in the experience through a 5"" screen, which I think is still the mos limiting aspect

I will never sufficiently stress the point that imo UX and product design is now the heart of the battle for AR. More than ever we can be grateful of the technology that has been created these past years, now as a rising industry we need all of our energy in finding the few usages so important that the audience will smoothly come and learn to use AR, so that the AR market is born.

There is also a high probability that this usage might be a game (not you Pokemon Go, something really focused on AR experience).

VR has VRchat, Beat Saber and Half Life Alyx as three ambassadors in three segments. We must find ours and it might be games.

That said, i can’t exclude that we might need web AR or headset to reach this point.","<div class=""md""><p>I’m definitely an AR enthusiast but I think you’re right on this point.

For point 1- look at the AR apps that have been hugely successful ie Pokémon go or Snapchat filters. These are app ideas that are pretty out there in terms of creativity (I wouldn’t have come up with it). They are also things you probably wouldn’t think of when designing an AR app. One of the Nintendo creators was interviewed and said he thinks AR is just another fad/medium. The best AR apps will be ones that are just good apps in general and don’t revolve around the idea of being AR. 

To point 2- I think designing for a mainstream AR app is like trying to come up with an iPhone app before the iPhone.

Augmented Reality has been with us from as early as 90-s, it became noticeable in \~2010. When Pokemon Go appeared 4 years ago I said: ""YES! this is the start of a new era. The world will never be the same."" lol. 

The tech is already here. ARKit is very reliable. Go Create! Apple Glasses won't bring something that isn't already on the iPhone. The placement of a 3D object in the real world will be the same. And all startups can develop their product on the iPhone for now. But I (sadly) don't see any.

The LiDAR solves one specific problem: better positioning of 3d objects. So they won't jiggle like before.

This is a fantastic start for an MR app! To scratch the surface, I find this incredibly cool - I’ve seen it before on LinkedIn tho (not sure if you are the creators) but I’d recommend finding a use case for this amazing creation!
Lastly, I’d appreciate if you share with us the tools you used to develop this - ARKit? Unity? Vuforia?... etc

Using powerful rendering servers with gaming console grade GPUs, memory, and processors located geographically near the user, we’re able to deliver a powerful but low friction, low latency experience.

The technology itself is not common sense.  I purposely did not even go into the technology.  The common sense bit is that you should be skeptical when the rest of industry and academia are spending years and billions of dollars to advance a technology and then someone says that they quantum leaped everyone.

HiggsFieldgoal,"I mean, the whole system needs to change, if not because it’s “not possible” merely because it’s “extraordinarily inefficient”.  
  
This stuff is not new BTW, and there were companies making incredibly dense 360 videos 10 years ago, although stitched from multiple cameras.  
  
The problem is storage and processing.  
  
But, the last time I was paying close attention to this, there were already breakthroughs being made with directional streaming, where the video would download higher resolution pixels for where you were actually looking.  
  
If you could tie that into foveated rendering techniques, you could stream a very small amount of data, and it would get the size down while being mostly imperceptible to the user… sort of like mp3, h264 and mpeg, which do sacrifice quality, but are way more efficient to download and playback.  
  
There are formats, like animated gif, that survive year after year despite being absurdly inefficient, but most systems figure out how to trim the fat pretty fast.  
  
You can’t see everywhere at once in 180, and especially not 360. It seems that it’s only a matter of time until there becomes some sort of new format, or maybe a new feature on an existing format, that is designed to utilize a signal for head and eye direction to only give max-density pixels to the places you will see.  
  
There’s already variable bitrate. This would be like regional variable bitrate.

<p>This stuff is not new BTW, and there were companies making incredibly dense 360 videos 10 years ago, although stitched from multiple cameras.  </p>

<p>The problem is storage and processing.  </p>

<p>But, the last time I was paying close attention to this, there were already breakthroughs being made with directional streaming, where the video would download higher resolution pixels for where you were actually looking.  </p>

<p>If you could tie that into foveated rendering techniques, you could stream a very small amount of data, and it would get the size down while being mostly imperceptible to the user… sort of like mp3, h264 and mpeg, which do sacrifice quality, but are way more efficient to download and playback.  </p>

<p>There are formats, like animated gif, that survive year after year despite being absurdly inefficient, but most systems figure out how to trim the fat pretty fast.  </p>

dagmx,"It’s a little easier to start if we take just single eye for a second and ignore 3D video. 

For immersive videos, they wrap around your field of view.  This effectively leaves you with a cropped image. 
So at any given moment you need to have roughly 4k of view in your current viewing crop to seem as sharp as a regular 4k film. 

As a result, 8k is basically the baseline for the quality. 

Now when you do stereo video, you need twice that. Canons current stereo capture system uses a single sensor split across both eyes. So you need 2x8k on one sensor. 

They could split into multiple sensors like most everyone will do for movie shoots, but that’s not the market they’re addressing. Their market is more plug and play consumer to professional shooters. Even their highest end video cameras are more geared to run and gun/ documentary shooting.

Shooting two cameras is pretty arduous. You end up with a lot more cost, a lot higher weight, difficulties syncing them and getting their eyes correct. Canon are rightfully sticking with a single sensor with a split lens for their user base. 

As to your question around capture vs display, canon could absolutely make a higher resolution sensor. There are already cameras with that resolution from cinema camera makers. The problem is how many people need that to make it worthwhile (it’ll be extremely expensive just for the camera, let alone any lenses to resolve that quality) , and what trade offs are you making ?

HistorianNo5068,"Yes, I'm the developer of the app. Let me clarify, the app is just now released on the Apple App store (2 weeks ago). App Store shows ""AGE=4+ years,"" indicating the app doesn't have any inappropriate content for kids.

I liked your suggestion on working with landscaping companies, and in fact, I did start with them first. The feedback I got was: Landscaping company employees meet their clients (homeowners) on-site, discuss, capture photos of the property/work area, and bring them back to the designers. Landscape Designers/Architects work with the photos on their computers using the landscaping app on their PCs and send the proposed design as photos back to their clients. So they seem to prefer the ""offline"" way for landscape design.

On the other hand, AR seems more apt for live/real-time applications/use-cases. For example, one of the issues I faced when I did a landscaping project where I converted a portion of my backyard into a paved patio, I couldn't visualize what the project would look like. I literally drew on the paper and shared it with the landscaping contractor. (We didn't hire a landscape designer.)  I solved this problem for myself using AR, and after talking to many homeowners/friends I realized that they were looking for similar solutions when they got their landscaping projects done. Hence, the motivation to bring the app to the market.

You have an excellent point though. I too think AR changes the way Landscaping Pros interact with their clients. Now, they have a way to a great conversation with their clients - and clients get a confidence boost as they sign the contract to pay thousands of dollars for the work yet to be done.","<div class=""md""><p>Yes, I&#39;m the developer of the app. Let me clarify, the app is just now released on the Apple App store (2 weeks ago).

Single_Whereas_655,"Hello, I wanted to give everyone a sneak peak into an immersive AR book reader utility that I’m developing for Quest 2/PRO called MR Books. This application offers a range of different reading experiences, such as reading an animated book while having your morning coffee to reading a full fledged novel on your living room couch. The application also offers full VR scenes, such as reading on top of a mountain, if you prefer to be fully immersived into a virtual world while reading. I will have a demo available in the next few weeks with the MVP features, so let me know here if you’re interested in trying it out.

Geolocating objects can be *fun* but as far as practical goes, it's just not. Maybe great for a game. 

The issue is there are so many concept videos out there showing how AR *could* be useful, but they are all smoke and mirrors. We can get half-way to as cool as a concept video, but that final 50% is the difference between useful and garbage.

Is it a cool idea to place a digital object in the real world that is always in the exact same place no matter what? yeah, there's places to go with that concept. Think of how you could replace billboards, or play hide and seek or something. Can we actually do that? Nope. phone GPS is not that accurate, we don't have a point cloud to work with, we cant even map the world well enough to assume a static mesh in the first place.

Abdulito-kun,"Hello r/augmentedreality !

Some months ago I posted a video to a game that I have been working on as a hobby. 6 months later, the project is evolving (quite slowly). 

I'm glad to let you know that our game ISOMOVERSE is in public beta with many features, like leaderboards per level and cloud saving (as long as more levels and debugging on the way !)

The goal of the game is to place the planets in positions such that they are at a good distance from linked planets (a red link means the planets are too close, and a blue line means they're too far away). The game is entirely developed with Unity/ARCore.

The game is in AR and trackless, meaning that you can play it wherever you want, without having to put an anchor in the world (like playing outside, etc). The choice of AR in this game is to let the user play with 3D geometry, some puzzles are just impossible to do in 2D !

I would be glad if you tried it out in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.InducedReality.ISOMOVERSE).

Abdulito-kun,"Thank you so much for your comment!

This is something I realized while trying out ARCore, the phone maps IRL space to world space ""automatically"", but it doesnt really know how to *exactly* map it. So what I guessed is that you can wait for the phone to ""maps"" everything you see (that's why you wait 'synchronisation' in the beginning) and then when it looks stable i put the planets in front of the player.

At that point the mapping is stable enough to play etc :) Thank you so much for your comment!","<div class=""md""><p>Thank you so much for your comment!</p>

We then have the [partner](https://www.worldcast.io/PartnerProgram) package which gives a lower CAST cost, co-branded portal as either a subdomain ([yourname.worldcast.io](https://yourname.worldcast.io)) or your own domain (portal.yoursite.yourdomain), you are protected by our legal (just in case someone got hurt using AR for any reason), and a few other things listed in the link.  


The cost to your client should reflect the time you are creating, etc. Some look at one CAST being $120 (without the Partner program) for the year and don't think of the money they are saving in development/hosting - and then some say well with co-branding I risk my client going to you - well - we are not an agency, and quite frankly after being involved in this industry for 11 years being involved with ad agencies for over 20 - if a client seeks out to do it themselves there are usually 2 reasons:  


They are not being serviced properly or they think they can do it themselves and save even more money.  


The reality is you probably want to get rid of the ones that want to do it themselves as historically they are clients that eat a lot of time in tire kicking, etc.   


We also hear creators and resellers say that they think $10/M per CAST is too expensive for them because if they had 10 CASTS (as an example) that would be $1,200 (not partner pricing) - again - there are no hidden ""per view"" costs and massive money is being saved from not needing a developer - also - that cost should either be passed onto the client or part of the annual budget if for personal business.  


Just using your comment to address a few things we have learned over the years to help others understand we really are trying to make it as simple for everyone.

MARINE-BOY,This is brilliant. Can you get in touch with the people of r/Ukraine who raise money to buy drones for the Ukrainians to drop mortar rounds onto Russians. Obviously they need more money to buy more drones and I’m quite positive that people would pay the price of a drone just to drop some munitions of Russian invaders meaning they could grow their drone fleet exponentially whilst simultaneously making significant gains in their war effort defending their home land. This would revolutionise warfare and gaming. You could name it Call Of Duty: Actual Warfare. I’ve a war veteran myself so know there’s many people who would love to take an active role in a real war zone from the safety of their own bedroom. I can’t think of any possible ethical issues.,"<div class=""md""><p>This is brilliant.

If you have a device create and sell that first to bridge it to computers. To have a platform of that you need lots of users and to have that you need the device working well. 

I have an augmented reality platform for multi screen computing with heads up display. Putting another display that is direct control of a drone for security without leaving AR or VR would be great and I would integrate a device and sell that device to users.

AugmentedThinker,"Hi, thanks - I've been travelling. I just read your message - thanks for the nudge. I've been doing projects for a decade and after building too many things on too many SDKs and not being included in an Apple buyout - I just stopped using other systems and started making my own in 2017 which came to be called [WorldCAST.io](https://WorldCAST.io) in 2020  


This vid is one of my personal projects, and I approach things from the ground up. The innovations I make from projects get passed to the many on the platform once we make a code-free module for the component.  


We are currently making a system based on the needs of one major chain - and the template derived from it will be available to all after this project is complete. I am about foundation/structure before scale. Future scale will fail if the basement is not built right - and after 11 years of doing this - I'm in no hurry to rush things in what is still the early days. A better video of course will be made when it's fully realized as a working version. Everything you see in the vid can be done on our platform - but some things may not make it - or be substantially better... feedback from closed trials will help.  
  
[Videos/tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfPWN2z5AUWkOGg8T5PswMA/videos) of what is available to the public on our platform.  


In regards to the video work, etc, I will never use CGI beyond the augmentation itself.

I would rather keep its authenticity. It's not even about budget - every single time I have tried to get marketing or external sources try to do any videos - they start overselling.  
  
This method allows me to keep banging out idea after idea after idea - and if you have followed me for a bit and have stuck with me - that's pretty much all I do. I serve up fresh content if not daily - it's weekly for sure.  
  
I might not be the right person to do the videos - but - I'm not going to oversell things - what I show is how the majority of people are going to look at anything created on our platform. I show the reality of it so that when you try it - the expectations are matched!  
  
Truth in advertising is my mantra - I learned this from two amazing friends when I did a brief stint at their advertising agency - and although brief - it forged a better understanding of that concept.  
  
Agencies/partners/creators - you can make your marketing however you want - I change ours all the time - not because we have not found our voice - but because I am still telling our story - that story is creativity. It's about possibility. It's my passion as a creator. I am showing versatility. I am showing the reality.  


I hope that helps and offers some insight.  


I just turned down a significant buyout so, I know our way is working and has value beyond hype vids - I want to keep it as real as possible for all - and available to all for the majority of things I show. Check out some of the tutorials/ideas in the link above - the platform is totally free to use.

OneConsideration7992,"Hi Everyone, I am in my final year at university and for my dissertation I am conducting research on individual personalities and digital fashion use. I aim to see if theres a trend in the 'type' of person who would be more likely to consume and interact with digital fashion than those who may not. I am also looking for both males and females so I can see if there's any gender differences as stereotypically fashion research has always been aimed at females. All the requirements are that you have an interest in physical fashion and/ or have bought digital fashion (this can also include game skins). You must be 18-35 years of age.

The emperor might have felt fooled because he paid for something that only he could see, his expectations were different. But what if there's clarity about who can see what? Let's take into account that the amount of people being able to view things going on in this realm is going to increase with the arrival of AR glasses. Furthermore, it's important to realise that these AR 'wearable' creations are not necessarily expensive purchases,  you can easily make them yourself, for free. 

A question of a different kind can be: why 'wear' AR when there's a phenomenon called physical fashion which has worked for centuries? Who needs the new possibilities offered by virtual materials? 

But isn't it a great advantage of AR that anyone can do anything anywhere, without forcing anybody to be part of it, to view it, to understand it or to appreciate it?

A manual diagram is super easy but when printed because set in stone and hard to modify. 

An AR demo is super flexible as production scales, changes, and adjusts but requires a large upfront time sink to create digital assets for meaningful training. 

No one if their right mind is going to spend 20 hours creating an AR demo of an assembly line machine animation when a quick sketch in a notebook takes 30 minutes worth of design work. The value of time will need to be outmatched by the value gained from using AR for it to make sense and take off in 99% of these applications.

<p>No one if their right mind is going to spend 20 hours creating an AR demo of an assembly line machine animation when a quick sketch in a notebook takes 30 minutes worth of design work. The value of time will need to be outmatched by the value gained from using AR for it to make sense and take off in 99% of these applications.</p>

As AR enabled devices & embedded computer vision/AI mature in coming years, clunky phones will give way to AR glasses & eventually contact lenses & neurables/bionic AR.

JustTheWriter,"This is cool technology, but it seems like a misapplication in a luxury retail environment. Perhaps I'm missing something.  


The facsimile does nothing to accommodate the *feeling* that people are seeking when they're trying on jewelry. Luxury goods – and for most people, Cartier rings are indeed luxury goods – are inherently aspirational. Having a client *actually* try on a piece helps bridge the gap between aspiration and the purchase. It's difficult to articulate the difference here, but if you've worked in high jewelry, you know that people are seeking a certain experience... and that this doesn't meet that need.   


This is even worse than telling a client, ""oh, we don't have that in the store... but we can order it for you."" Instead, it's ""oh... we have it, but we'd like you to see what a ***picture of your hand wearing it would look like.*** Here, let me grab my iPad while you wear this black sizing band and stick your hand under a camera that looks like an Ikea desk lamp."" Rather than make anyone's job easier, this just creates more barriers to selling.   


The only useful applications for this might be in being able to show a client what an out-of-stock ring or size might look like, allowing clients to ""try on"" multiple styles when it wouldn't be feasible from a security standpoint, or to scale this down to a phone app so that clients who can't immediately make it into a store can try on rings.

quaderrordemonstand,"Its *very* interesting that you are doing this. I work in this field and I respect the gravity of what you do so I want to offer some unvarnished advice.

Firstly, the tracking will not be stable if you use the floor as a reference and Reality composer probably isn't going to be good enough either. The ideal reference would be the circular clamp that is holding the persons head in place. However, the material its made of is reflective, so less reliable for visual tracking.

One option, perhaps easier, is to attach small labels to the clamp with visual anchors on them for the camera to see. The software can use those anchors to know where the clamp is in the view. I don't know if reality composer can do that if you need to investigate some other method.

If visual tracking won't be good enough then perhaps you can do it with LIDAR rather than visually.  That means one of the recent pro models in iPhone/iPad terms. Some software that tracks the shape of the clamp. I don't know of any piece of software that does that. However, it might exist and somebody here might know of it.

Also, you really need to simplify the workflow before this is a practical tool. Too much manual interaction, too many conversion steps. The process should be automatically creating a dataset from DICOM files on some kind of server and then selecting it in the app on the device. Obviously it should be secure and *very* clear which patient's data is which.

I'd offer to get involved as its an interesting project but, to be frank, I'm pretty expensive to employ and I have a lot of work anyway.

In the end the database just wasn't capable of processing search requests for the web due to it's xml streaming nature. it was frustrating as fuck, but honestly some good came out of it. now members of the public could search the database for anything to do with the 80 million species records at the museum, something that could never be done before. it was successful _enough_ that the qatari government reached out to me and offered me a position at their ""National Museum of Qatar"" in Doa, since at that time i was probably the foremost expert on bringing the KE EMu platform online since it's main role was as a backend for a windows PC application. however, moving to qatar did not align with my obsessive drinking and partying mentality at the time so i did not accept the offer and instead went on to work at SEGA then some big advertising agencies.  now i live in chicago and own my own business consulting fortune 500 companies from a software architecture perspective.

<p>Lately, he&#39;s been getting banned from several subreddits, and has in response created fake versions of those subs (i.e. <a href=""/r/Unity3D_Tutorials"">r/Unity3D_Tutorials</a> instead of the real <a href=""/r/Unity_Tutorials"">r/Unity_Tutorials</a>), where he bans anyone who criticizes him.  Please don&#39;t fall for this.</p>

Well, I run my own subreddit (r/UnityCurated) and I routinely comment positively on other's posts.  Check my history.  But you're right, I'm totally just a troll.

Dilmer, you need to engage with the community instead of just spamming your own videos everywhere.  In over a year I have NEVER seen you comment meaningfully on any post that wasn't your own.  Reddit rules state that less than 10% of your posts/comments should be self-promotion.

This may come as a shock to you, but in order to be respected, you must first give respect.  

Incessant spamming and half baked [shoddy tutorials with technical errors](https://www.reddit.com/r/augmentedreality/comments/c429xx/placing_tv_screens_in_augmented_reality_can/eryo45b/?context=3) do not garner respect from this community. 

I'd urge everyone to report OP as spam and block him, he's just a wannabe influencer who only cares about growing his subscriber count, not teaching or engaging with this subreddit.

Dilmer, I am going to leave you with a quote for you to always remember:

“One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say.”
Bryant H. McGill

I appreciate the shout-out, and I get it. I am honestly doing what I can to find the balance of giving as well as supporting my amazing team members so that you and other creators can have access to the things - [we are like a bag of chips in the aisle - not for all - but those that take a bit usually love it.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wilmcreynolds_education-tourism-history-activity-6966180510867804160-dnQN/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)  
I mention the things below because (and have peppered linkedin posts - I'm not trying to be anon on here - LI is just where I have made a lot of friends but am moving more to the subs as I now have many friends here as well - yay!!!) I truly want everyone to know I have ONLY built for the people. I don't sell NFT/Blockchain/Metaverse/etc I'm not about hype - we are a sandbox for no-code WebAR with a decent record of absolute fails over the years. I love AR so much, truly.  
I don't post much on here in terms of comments as I live on the spectrum - and I ""DON'T"" want to come across the wrong way, especially on Reddit! I am MUCH better talking as I don't have to read what I type - I can just spew it.  
Our $10 a CAST plan for premium always ate at me as it had a FEW more features that I wanted to be in Freemium. I did it to appease early investors - no longer.  
That ends this week.   


Next push either tomorrow or Wednesday - all will be available for free for personal AND commercial use on the creator package - no complicated price matrixes (we've never had that) and no pay-per-view - I've HATED that since Metaio days - it's bullshit. How do any of you know how much your creation is going to be viewed? How do you budget for that? Unrealistic AF.  
There is a $10 per CAST/m cost to remove the banner on top (we need to make money somewhere for servers and food, haha) and of course, we have a serious ""partner"" package coming that also has a WYSIWYG Portal Branding editor.  


I partnered with IBM a few years ago and our stuff is on a custom bare metal siloed build with global CDN distribution and load balancing in play. I mention this because it's important - we have industry leading compression - and our TOS/TOU covers our creators in case someone was ever hurt using the portal. I never see that being talked about - most portals by others just come bare.

At WorldCAST - my ONLY goal has been to make AR accessible for those looking to dip their toes in the water of Marker/Markerless/Geospatial.

What we offer - and how we have stayed alive during two pivots and especially Covid is our stuff is being used by communities. I only say this because I'm not some person that just jumped on the hype train of things.   


My goal since 2011 has been and continues to stand for democratization.  


I would say we arguably have one of the better if not the best WYSIWYG Web-based creation studio and I appreciate all that check it out. We didn't spend the money on marketing for our WebAR pivot from our 2018 build that we were launching in 2020 to further innovate and make things stronger - so the fact that we have had so much success lately by world of mouth is very humbling.

From someone who's worked with 8th wall for years - I completely disagree with everything you're saying and calling them ""enemy #1"" is just vitriolic.

“The Child Who is Not Embraced by the Village Will Burn it Down to Feel its Warmth” 

You seem like a good person because you came up for others and spoke your truth, much respect to you fellow Earthican, the world needs more people like that. 

So here is my rebuttal. 

That pricing of $9.99 for individuals is for non commercial work according to their sales person whom I contacted for clarification. 
Even for a small startup I was told that I would need to pay their $1500+ per month license even if I only want to make AR business cards and sell them for family run businesses and small farmers, don’t even get me started on being able to make textbooks for schools without being an educator in the school system. The last one hurt the most because it felt like they denied me the opportunity to help poor children access to improved education. 
For your $9.99 - $99 you may look and tinker with the tools but not use them for work related purposes. 
 It’s the age old control tactic of feudal master and slave, you may use my estates land to grow crops, but you are forbidden to take your own surplus crops to market for sale and provide extra income for your family in the hopes that you too can eventually become economically sufficient and buy surplus arable land. It’s fucking mental slavery man!!

I’m sure everyone working at 8th Wall are exemplary people no doubt, I am not against the soldiers, I’m against the war and that war is against giving people false hope and ripping it away.
They used Bernaisian marketing tactics to bullshit people into giving them money with hopes of using their tools to make a living and a change in other less fortunate peoples lives, so they shouldn’t be surprised if someone counters their bs and uses those same Freudian tactics against them to bring attention to their plight.  

Maybe I just had shit experience with their sales person who happened to have bad day but after his “sux to be you” response to my inquiry regarding Africa and the economic state we find ourselves in, not even a thought of consideration to maybe pass it up the chain of command  to maybe see if some solution or work around can be found that will inevitably prove such a high ROI for them that they won’t know what even hit them, so yes, fuck em, until they come right and mean what they say or say what they mean. 
If you claim in your marketing to be for the people and throw around terms like democracy and democratisation then you better mean it 100%  Because people are desperate these days and they will turn on you and eat the rich if they even get so much as a sniff of corporate bullshit. 

That’s it, I’ve spoken my truth and until they change their ways and truly embrace the people as they so claim, they will remain my enemy #1 standing in the way of uplifting people with dignity.

If you claim in your marketing to be for the people and throw around terms like democracy and democratisation then you better mean it 100%  Because people are desperate these days and they will turn on you and eat the rich if they even get so much as a sniff of corporate bullshit. </p>

<p>That’s it, I’ve spoken my truth and until they change their ways and truly embrace the people as they so claim, they will remain my enemy #1 standing in the way of uplifting people with dignity. </p>

<p>I apologise for nothing in my desperate attempts to draw attention to the plight of us prols.</p>

I really like the flourishes which I feel increase the engagement and the depth of viewer attention. (Speaking for myself here. Not sure what would happen if I were double screening GoT reruns.) For example, the mint leaves that look like little birds. The animated mint leaves coming toward me. And the interactive hand tracking/motion. You could have just had a Colgate box. A few nanoseconds of attention. But you went the extra mile! I watched it several times.

So, please tell us more! I've been looking into MyWebAR along with other packages. With what platforms did you create the animated 3D image? How did you do the import into MyWebAR? Are UFO's real? Curious minds need to know ;-)

Well, this is where i'm at. Custom Home Mapper is a collection of tools and minigames that allows you to map your living space into a VR environment. You can create a detailed home re-creation or play minigames like 'Lightspeed Smuggler', this space shooting/power management game i'm working on. There's a dozen apps and minigames in the collection:

https://sidequestvr.com/app/1701/custom-home-mapper

It has multiplayer (including a free android/flatscreen guest app, so you can invite any of your friends to visit you inside your 'home'.) as well as a wide variety of AR implementations for the various minigames.

Microsoft already demonstrated Holoportation a process that lets John teleport into Robert's room John can appear as himself or as an avatar.

The bottom of this page has a fascinating [old video showing how a man's daughter using Holoportation to  teleport into his room](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/holoportation-3/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fprojects%2Fholoportation%2Fdefault.aspx) where he can interact with her. The first part of the video shows the man's friend do the same thing.

I don't know when this type of teleportation / holoportation will be common, but that's what they're working on unless they stopped working on it.  I'm playing the the NReal SDK but I don't think those glasses have the ability to emulate a lot of the Hololen's capabilities.  But maybe soon, people wearing inexpensive AR glasses, like NReal, may be able to ""teleport to anywhere with anyone at anytime"" as the man in the Microsoft video says.

People wearing tiny AR glasses might also like to perform ordinary tasks, such as watching TV or playing cards (while at the same time) having the ability to interact with remote friends who could appear around them as AR avatars or as themselves. That's the premise behind the Hololens Super Bowl party concept video.

People at bus stops might even engage with one another if they're wearing compatible AR glasses. Google Glass didn't quite pull all this off, but technology's evolved since then. But there's still a ways to go even with the Hololens and Magic Leap.

On the other hand, maybe like with cell phones, people wearing AR glasses will focus more on what's happening on their virtual AR screens. That person sitting next to you staring into space may in fact be watching a movie and checking his Twitter feed -- lost in his own world as if he was glued to a cell phone.","<div class=""md""><p>Microsoft thinks MR will bring people together.

DynMads,"Microsoft has very specific use cases in mind for their in-office/in-home MR products (like the hololens) which either involves work or meetings as well as a bit of free-time accessibility. But all of it is bound to a finite location, which separates it from what most AR Glasses manufacturers are working on and striving for. It's kind of the difference between a Desktop computer bound to your home/office and a smartphone.

The computer can do so much more than the phone can, in terms of computing capabilities and whatnot. But it is bound to a location, whereas the mobility of the smartphone gives it so many more capabilities.

When I look at AR I think of it this way: imagine your web-browser and how you have read and write access to its contents. You can do practically whatever you want, because everything exists on your client-side while the content is computed somewhere else. Just open the inspector, and there it is. Simple right?

Now in the real world, you only have read rights to the physical spaces you inhabit. With AR you could get write access to those spaces as well. Basically the real world becomes like the browser example. You can paint it over with whatever you want and the glasses won't do the heavy lifting. They will act as a thin client, where content is streamed to the device itself. This way you can focus much more on storage for caching and offline usage as well as small compute units that won't have to do too much. Mostly focus on feeding the right data to the cloud so you get the right visualizations back.

This in effect is what I see as the isolating element to it. The computer became the utopia for individuals because it's a common interface that everyone can operate and speak, yet customize in a myriad of ways that seems neigh-on infinite.

AR would extend this concept into the real world (Augmented Reality does not exist on its own.

That's kind of what I hope MS working on - the ability to transition between states in a headset that's not simply one that can do AR OR VR via a switch. Someone once suggested using polarization to control the amount of reality that we can see.

A long time ago Sulon worked on a headset that let users move between AR and VR. That's demonstrated in the old ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" concept video where you're in a real office where magic AR beans appear. The beans grow an AR stalk which crashes through the REAL ceiling and an AR giant reaches through the ceiling and pulls you into the sky where everything is pure VR.  During that experience the user transitions between reality, augmented reality, pure VR and then back into real reality. One writer described his experience which was similar to that. There was no concept of AR or VR. There was simply whatever we want to call it. Intel once called it Blended Reality. They stopped work on their project too.

president_josh,"I also don't know how long it would take for traditional headsets to gain the ability to show AR and also block out the real world well enough to show pure VR.

The Sulon headset could do that because it showed the real world through **passthrough** cameras -- kind of like what we find on the Rift S and Quest.

LYNX just introduced an MR/AR headset (for $1499) but they haven't shown us what it does. It uses **passthrough** cameras like the Sulon headset did. Those cameras let you see an image of the real word instead of the real world. The software can then mix different combinations of imagery from the real world with digital imagery. That gives these types of cameras the ability to show ..

1. Pure reality
2. Pure AR
3. Pure VR
4. A mix of all three

So, these types of headsets can completely block out the real world because users only see the real world through the headset's **passthrough** cameras.

Because a headset like LYNX uses passthrough cameras, maybe the future is closer than we think. Headsets like Magic Leap and Hololens don't use passthrough cameras.

A use case might be in a school where students wear compact AR/VR glasses. The teacher makes an AR Mars appear and an AR portal appears next to Mars.

A student will see AR Mars. And the student could walk up to the AR portal, walk through it and gradually see how his real world disappears as he keeps walking forward. Eventually he finds himself in a pure VR environment where he's ON Mars where there's a VR portal. 

.. He can explore VR Mars and when he's ready to return, walk back through the VR portal where gradually he transitions from pure VR to (a mix of VR + AR) then back to pure reality where he's back in the real classroom.

Based on what a Sulon tester wrote about his experience, that classroom example sounds possible and similar to what he saw when he tested the Sulon. He was amazed at the adventure he took. 

 Future headset wearers could be in whatever reality state they like if the headset could vary the levels of real reality, virtual reality and augmented reality that the user sees.

I don't know, but maybe an AR/VR headset like the LYNX wouldn't have a problem with bright light making it difficult to see AR objects if the headset is working like Adobe After Effects. After Effects lets us overlay digital imagery on top of real-world footage using compositing. 

Headsets like the LYNX and Sulon use the same type of compositing technique. The only difference is that instead of seeing it all play out on a computer screen, users can see it through an AR/VR headset.

LYNX is asking a lot of money for an AR/VR headset when we haven't even seen what it does. But it's up for pre-order.

[https://uploadvr.com/lynx-r1-standalone-passthrough/](https://uploadvr.com/lynx-r1-standalone-passthrough/)

It's still a bulky headset so I don't know how long it might take before a headset with it's capabilities could look and feel like a tiny pair of Nreal glasses. I don't know if headsets with **passthrough** weigh more than headsets that don't have **passthrough** cameras. 

So maybe it will be a while before we have amazing AR/VR/MR features AND compact comfortable AR/VR/MR eye glasses. Hreal is a start, but they can't do what the LYNX does or the Sulon did.","<div class=""md""><p>I also don&#39;t know how long it would take for traditional headsets to gain the ability to show AR and also block out the real world well enough to show pure VR.</p>
