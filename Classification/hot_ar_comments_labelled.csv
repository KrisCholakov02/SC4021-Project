- you’ve spoken of Frame as a lifestyle-AI kind of device; do you foresee this or a future model pushing into activity/sports as have some other glasses wearables?

- one of the challenges for me personally was getting up to speed with MicroPython; Lua is a different beast (good and bad for folks); in addition to the store you’ve spoken towards, do you foresee other languages or approaches eventually hooking into Monocle/Frame/future products?

- across the team, what’s the favorite color frame (of what’s available); what would be a frame color or colorway that sits as near-impossible for now, but would be cool for each of you?",

2. Is there a monthly subscription in addition to the price of the frame to access the features and artificial intelligence? If yes, how much will it be?

3. Is it possible for the frame to analyze questions and objects without the need to speak a question to it? I mean, can they utilize the built-in camera?

Thank you.",
92,Btavangar,"Frame is designed to be light enough, intelligent enough, and have enough battery to set you down a path of weaving AI into your daily life.  The ways this can manifest are extremely diverse across personal/social, productivity, health/safety, memory augmentation…. Personally I love employing AI web search like perplexity to query the places, products, shops, and processes i see on a daily basis to understand more about them from whats available/timely on the live web.  

Good news on battery life: as of latest testing, we get 6 hours continuous use — so with normal anticipated use of 20mins per hour you get ~18hrs of use.  Pretty cool.

I can’t comment on other tools because AVP is so fresh (and different) and other stuff hasn’t really panned out.  So we’re a spectator along with everyone else!",
93,Btavangar,"It might be! Depends on what you want to get done. Noa is up for long conversations but also surgical, precise answers from services like Perplexity and GPT.",
94,Btavangar,"Frame and our broader platform are open source which has many implications.  One is that folks in the community can (and are) building all kinds of applications like timers, navigation, teleprompters, calendar/notifications etc for it.  An initiative we will be working on over the next few months after launch is building a storefront to enable efficient discovery and distribution of these 3rd party apps.  But we dont want to do it in the usual way.  We see an opportunity to leverage AI to bring these things to you contextually as you navigate your day.  And of course if you intentionally ask for a given app or function.

Right now, Frame requires BLE pair to your phone and a pipe to the internet. But yes, we are also looking at deploying small, local models to create a low latency non-web connected experience as well.",
95,Btavangar,Not a dumb question at all — this is a challenge for us on the industrial design side of things.  We’ve tackled this in two ways: 1) design a structure which fits the median 70-80% of the bell curve; 2) use materials with enough flex to bend to a wider head.,

To give you an idea, we sold out of a year’s worth of purchased stock in a couple of days and have been busy getting more to meet all of the demand.  Everyone from indie AI hackers to large enterprises to industrial giants.  And wow the media coverage.  All of this has been organic — no paid marketing.",
98,HammerFET,"You can stream pictures but not video. It's limited by the speed of the Bluetooth connection which is around 40kB/s. Depending on the image size you set on Frame, and how much you want to compress it, you can get around a frame per second or two",
99,HammerFET,"We looked into it but they were quite bulky and power hungry. They would have made the arms a lot chunkier and we'd need bigger batteries to get decent battery life. We also figured since most people have wireless earbuds these days anyway, maybe it wasn't critical to include them",
100,HammerFET,"Yeah there's two ways of doing it really. Frame itself is designed to be low power so doesn't have an application processor similar to what you might find in a phone or SBC. It does however have an FPGA which is directly handling the camera input. FPGA devs could leverage this for custom vision DSP and combine it with the onboard microcontroller to do some very clever things. This would be vert fast and efficient, but the most complex in terms of development.  
  
The other way would be to stream image frames to a phone/PC and make use of the powerful hardware there for vision processing. This would be a lot slower but maybe a better way to get a proof of concept together before diving deeper. There will be more controls on the camera API soon so it should be fairly flexible and hackable. We have some python test scripts in our codebase that show how it could be done",

103,HammerFET,"Excited to get Frame in your hands! :) 

You can definitely show full screen images, but the speed is limited by the Bluetooth speed from your phone up to Frame. You could stream images but it would be a still picture every second or two. Saying that, there is the built in sprite engine and vector graphics engine which will allow for smooth animations. Eventually Noa will use these, but we're also excited to see what other apps people can come up with that use those feature",
104,Btavangar,"Personally, navigation and calendar notifications so im always on time!",
105,HammerFET,For me it'll be leveraging the AR graphics for making cool games and widgets :),
106,HammerFET,"Frame's built in mic can capture fairly decent quality audio. As we progress on the AI side of things, we'll gradually expand from interpreting speech, to interpreting sounds in general. For developers, they can already get started with this. On the firmware level, everything is already in place to record, stream, and change between various audio quality settings",
107,Btavangar,Anything can be bonded to them but it’s at your own risk :),
108,Btavangar,Great! Ships express with DHL so it should be within a week.,
109,HammerFET,"Great question :)

One of the biggest challenges was waiting on the super long leadtimes of different parts and assemblies. On firmware, a lot of code had to be written before we had any real hardware. On hardware we had to do the mechanical design before we pinned down the final electronics. And for a long time we couldn't really test the optics because we didn't have the graphics ready. It was a lot of chicken and egg. Often it meant that we had to think ahead of the curve and predict potential problems early. A lot of tasks happening in parallel, where you had to be comfortable to take risks and be ready to change something quickly if it turns out not to work later. All in all, we really had to work as a team and not try to just do things our own way

We did a lot of iterations, but it all came together in the end :)

Regarding your second question, Frame for me sort of takes me back to the early days of computing. It's not at all powerful hardware compared to the phones we carry around in our pocket, but it represents a blank slate where totally new possibilities might exist. Unlike so many devices today, Frame isn't designed to only consume, but also to create. To me at least, that represents the real essence of computing. I hope because of this, folks find new and ways to use Frame in their day to day lives, without being constrained to specific ways of thinking, or be biased by how a company says they should use the product. The user should be free to make anything they like, and quickly the line between consumer and developer might disappear again :)",
110,Btavangar,Yes!  Ships worldwide with DHL,
111,Btavangar,"No waveguides — it’s a half baked technology which is overhyped in our industry.  Does us all a disservice. The way they are currently being made, Waveguides are a pipe dream which cannot be made reliably with high yield so the costs are astronomical.  And thats not even including the microLEDs (also half baked at the moment) which are required to generate light through them because they lose so much light during the process. 

Now, if waveguides were made with an additive process… ;)

We use tried and true technologies which can be procured and manufactured at high yield like geometric prisms and microOLED displays.",

I actually think there's a strong argument for using webxr on the quest 3. Especially if you are planning on using it for teaching. Webxr has an *incredibly low entry point*. Unity usually runs pretty well most modern computers. Unreal Engine requires a stronger system (1tb might disappear quickly and 32gb ram is recommended).

I'd recommend webxr if you do plan on teaching it. The threejs site have some nice xr examples for the quest 3 [https://threejs.org/examples/?q=webxr#webxr\_xr\_controls\_transform](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=webxr#webxr_xr_controls_transform)",

176,Any-Tone-5741,"Given your interest in augmented reality (AR) development and your preference for a laptop over a desktop due to logistical reasons, let's address your concerns.

Firstly, the belief that laptops aren't suitable for AR development isn't entirely accurate anymore. Modern laptops, especially those designed for gaming and creative work, come equipped with powerful processors, high-performance graphics cards, and sufficient RAM to handle AR development tasks. The ASUS TUF 15.6"" FX507ZI F15I74070 Gaming Laptop you're considering, with a 4070 GPU, is a testament to this advancement. Such specifications are indeed capable of supporting AR development environments and the necessary software.

However, there are a few considerations:

* **Performance vs. Mobility**: Laptops offer mobility but can't always match the raw power and upgradability of a desktop. If you prioritize portability and space-saving, a high-spec laptop like the one mentioned could serve you well for AR development.
* **Future-Proofing**: AR and VR technologies are rapidly evolving. While the laptop may meet current needs, desktops offer easier upgrades for future requirements.
* **Thermal Management**: High-performance tasks like game development and AR simulations can cause laptops to heat up more than desktops, potentially throttling performance.
* **Budget vs. Needs**: If the laptop fits within your budget and meets the minimum requirements for the development tools you plan to use (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine), it could be a worthwhile investment. However, ensure it has enough RAM (16GB is often recommended for development tasks) and check the compatibility with your AR headset.

In summary, if the laptop meets your current needs for AR development, offers the convenience you're looking for, and fits within your budget, it could be a good investment. However, consider the long-term aspects and whether a desktop might offer better value and performance in the long run, especially if you're planning to develop more demanding AR experiences.

Given the specifics of the ASUS TUF laptop you mentioned, it seems like a capable machine for starting your journey into AR development. Still, ensure to review its specifications against the software requirements for AR development to make an informed decision.",

194,HiggsFieldgoal,"I mean, the whole system needs to change, if not because it’s “not possible” merely because it’s “extraordinarily inefficient”.  
  
This stuff is not new BTW, and there were companies making incredibly dense 360 videos 10 years ago, although stitched from multiple cameras.  
  
The problem is storage and processing.  
  
But, the last time I was paying close attention to this, there were already breakthroughs being made with directional streaming, where the video would download higher resolution pixels for where you were actually looking.  
  
If you could tie that into foveated rendering techniques, you could stream a very small amount of data, and it would get the size down while being mostly imperceptible to the user… sort of like mp3, h264 and mpeg, which do sacrifice quality, but are way more efficient to download and playback.  
  
There are formats, like animated gif, that survive year after year despite being absurdly inefficient, but most systems figure out how to trim the fat pretty fast.  
  
You can’t see everywhere at once in 180, and especially not 360. It seems that it’s only a matter of time until there becomes some sort of new format, or maybe a new feature on an existing format, that is designed to utilize a signal for head and eye direction to only give max-density pixels to the places you will see.  
  
There’s already variable bitrate. This would be like regional variable bitrate.  
  
Once it’s possible to view this stuff effectively, there will be a lot more incentive to generate it.

As for resolution, the immersive videos are something like 8k per eye. That’s quite a bit higher than the Titan can output by total pixel count

The cap is really going to be the hardware decoders. M2 caps out at 8k (though apparently can do stereo and multiple 8k) according to the release notes. Not sure if that’s a real limit or just the highest marketing term they went with.",

Can I understand that canon is saying ""at least do better than 4k per eye to utilize the AVP specs better"" ? Maybe they're trying to do 8k like you say but the interviewer wasn't understanding them.

Looked into the m2, this is apples chip housing the cpu/GPU right? So MVP was shipped w M2 but is capable of displaying more, is the issue that we've reached a point display technology is more advanced than capture/processing/storage capabilities?",
202,staffan_spins,Foveated rendering helps,
203,JaggedMetalOs,The Insta360 Titan mentioned in that article does 11k resolution 3D 360 video.,
204,dagmx,"It’s a little easier to start if we take just single eye for a second and ignore 3D video. 

For immersive videos, they wrap around your field of view.  This effectively leaves you with a cropped image. 
So at any given moment you need to have roughly 4k of view in your current viewing crop to seem as sharp as a regular 4k film. 

As a result, 8k is basically the baseline for the quality. 

Now when you do stereo video, you need twice that. Canons current stereo capture system uses a single sensor split across both eyes. So you need 2x8k on one sensor. 

They could split into multiple sensors like most everyone will do for movie shoots, but that’s not the market they’re addressing. Their market is more plug and play consumer to professional shooters. Even their highest end video cameras are more geared to run and gun/ documentary shooting.

Shooting two cameras is pretty arduous. You end up with a lot more cost, a lot higher weight, difficulties syncing them and getting their eyes correct. Canon are rightfully sticking with a single sensor with a split lens for their user base. 

As to your question around capture vs display, canon could absolutely make a higher resolution sensor. There are already cameras with that resolution from cinema camera makers. The problem is how many people need that to make it worthwhile (it’ll be extremely expensive just for the camera, let alone any lenses to resolve that quality) , and what trade offs are you making ? (More pixels in the same sensor size means less light per pixel)",

But 45 degrees is not a difficult FOV to setup in a test. I can look at his test pattern, and see his results are not similar to what I’m seeing. I’m not speculating. I am sure.  
  
In his results, it’s a blurry mess. With just my eye, I can’t make any calculations in terms of PPD, but I can clearly see specific things. In his results, “Ariel 6 point” is just a slightly stratified blurry smudge. But I know I can see the individual letters in HMD when that image is occupying 45 degrees.

If his setup was able to resolve individual pixels, and could measure their density, there’d be a lot of other types of observations that would be less suspect of measurement failure. “Blurry” is not one of them. “Blurry” is a common camera problem.  
  
So, his camera images look blurrier than the AVP actually looks, and he wrote a whole article about how blurry the AVP looks. It’s weird that this happened, and it will undoubtedly be embarrassing for the guy when he realizes what happened, but here we are.

For the third time, you have no idea what you're talking about. You're completely missing the most basic concepts here needed for such an experiment and assuming looking through a lens to  display is same as looking at something IRL. You can't grab a virtual image from the lens and measure it's size with a ruler, nor do you know the exact focus distance the AVP lens has.

Glasses are the way. There's just too few use cases vs the tradeoffs that you'll get so much more with glasses and headsets.

With the added benefit of economies of scale from all the big players going that direction, the price differential will be massive between them.

300,korneliuslongshanks,"Ok. Explain to me why those will be good enough then? What is the threshold?

 I'll start.

Battery Life:

How large can the batteries be in a contact lens? Do the batteries need to be flexible? That's fine, doable. What if something happens to the battery? Acid in your eyes. The prototype for the Mojo that they can't even legally insert, they ""claim"" will last up to 2 hours. That's with low levels of brightness, single color, .5 mm with 14000 pixels per inch, at that distance is 280 pixels diameter across. That's their words, but if you've seen it, basically useless outside of basic text display.

Do I think batteries will get better, perhaps a revolutionary change, I certainly hope so, doesn't mean it's possible?

Utility:

We've seen a million heads up display AR products for sports, military, motorcycle helmets in glasses and goggles etc. Extremely low utility. Is it cool to see those things, sure, but there's a reason why they haven't taken off to the mass market, and because it's a novelty. The cool factor wears off quickly especially for the price.

Price:

What do you think the price will have to be to make all these specialty components, especially without the economies of scale? How many do you honestly think they would sell?

Longevity:

How long will they last being semi flexible, immersed in tears, non replaceable batteries. Will they be used for both eyes?

Pixel Density:

To get basic single color pixel density, it takes 14000 pixels per inch. There is only so small we can make things. Have we reached that limit, no, but there is a limit. What would they need to bring color into it, or video, or brighter screens? And increasing those increases the power consumption.

Since you are so sure these won't be an issue because of what?

366,riddlemaker01,"I don't think the lack of educational qualifications should be a problem. Usually, when looking for a product designer, companies look not only at your experience, but also at your ability to solve different problems. So, quickly moving on to your portfolio question - try not only to show the design, but also describe what features you've added are most useful and how they will solve user problems. This will definitely earn you some points. 

In terms of projects, I would recommend focusing on those that will enhance your design thinking skills. I find it easy to design exactly what was asked for. The main thing that makes you a good product designer is not only designing what was asked, but also trying to dive deeper and think of additional solutions that will improve the product and bring more positive experience to the users. Sometimes it might be something small, like changing a dropdown element on a radio button, but it's your job to understand what will be beneficial in specific cases and be able to advocate for your decisions.

Product design job boosted up a lot of skills that not only help me do my job but also help me irl. In my opinion, product design path will definitely not be a bad decision, it will add multiple soft and hard skills to your initial pack and they can help you in your future plans.",

455,tyanthony16415,Modifying a VR headset to support ar using a Xbox kinetic,
456,s6x,AR means a thousand different things.  Be more specific about what you want to do.,
457,tyanthony16415,"Something similar to the quest 2 ar where it shows your area in color/black and grey with fake hands exc show screens in front of my keyboard using the headset 
I've seen someone do it before but can't find it anymore",
458,s6x,"If you don't communicate with complete sentences and punctuation, it is a bit difficult to understand what you're saying.

If you want tracked CG hands and CG images composited over photographic imagery, I don't understand why you would want to use a kinect or any similar time of flight/depth system.  Ultraleap is the gold standard for hand tracking.  You could composite your CG on top of imagery you get from a camera mounted to the HMD.

However the latency on consumer webcams is far too high for AR, so you need a low latency camera, probably 20-30ms max: https://www.e-consystems.com/.

Additionally the photographic imagery will be 2d unless you get two cameras and then you're rolling your own stero combination--2d will not work well within a certain range.

The only reason you'd need depth would be for complex occlusion and at that point, with the rest of the above, you're engineering your own AR headset.  Even without that, this is a pretty involved engineering challenge which very few people can do well.  It would certainly cost ten times what a new AVP (let alone a q3) would in time and materials, and you'd end up with something way worse.",

472,totesnotdog,Tilt5 has unreal and Unity support and of course quest 3 is pretty robust,
473,totesnotdog,Well tilt5 at least brings up the solid case that seated entertainment has a huge place In AR in that case. Give it a look see man. It’s pretty fun to use,

475,totesnotdog,Tilt5 does fit the checkboxes in your case based on price range. Only decent wireless AR glasses I know of I’d consider spending money on tho are maybe XReal for entertainment and maybe digilens if I had to do dev work.

The vuzix ultralite is also an option.

That way they can be culled, but still remain where they last were if the user goes back into the same area.  So I guess, yes, it's GeoLocation based in that way lol.

Putting headset on kids in zoo, mostly the same like wearing headset during sex with wife.

And the point with the safety also very simple - human eye have FOV more than any headset, and human eye have resolution bigger than any existing camera able represent, and I even not talking about realtime calculation to show it - but people wearing that headsets and starting cooking (hot pan, etc) or even worse - driving.

Of course these could have some use compared to Apple Vision Pro or Quest 3 with being lighter etc but for me(of course that is just me) to buy these price need to be much lower and probably at that point there are real wireless AR glasses to buy.

Closest thing what i have heard is Snapdragon Spaces based glasses but still waiting when it is possible to actually buy those, will see if rumored smart glasses(not AR which are rumored to come in 2027) from Meta rumored to come 2025 will be the first consumer glasses which have screen, look like regular glasses and are wireless with maybe having camera for AI features.

Meta is also going to release their EMG device with the Smart glasses and second generation with AR glasses so maybe if there will be Snapdragon Spaces based AR glasses this year i will have to also buy that Meta smart glasses with a screen in 2025 because that EMG device for using the os and typing messages could be worth it compared to full AR glasses.

589,wilmaster1,"In my view there are a couple of uses that i have seen:
Broadcasts with live ar elements overlayed. This is often seen in for example major sports events, and sometimes concerts, where they add effects on the video stream, see the Carolina Panthers video as an example.
Ar elements on top of a stage, usually lights or beamer projections, for example with a very thin net to pretend it's on stage, or projection mapping on objects. Just look for projection mapping on stage and you should find a lot of them.
Last one is phone or hmd based AR elements, where the user uses a phone or headset to see the AR elements and perhaps control them. There are some companies like ARound, but snap has dabbled together with live nation as well.

Personally I'm really interested in the third, but it's also one riddles with issues. The personal usage makes it very hard to exactly control. Thereby, localization of AR content  in event spaces (often dark and flashy lights) is extremely tricky, requiring a tradeoff with the physical content.

Possibly Niantic Lightship can do android and ios. Not sure how to handle Quest. But very good topic, I will look into it",
602,HiggsFieldgoal,"First of all, there really isn’t a monolithic “AR”.
  
Design, to me, is always about three things:  
  
Input: How a user interacts.  
Information: What is being communicated to the user.  
Aesthetic: How it looks, and more importantly, how it feels to use it.  
  
Bonus 4th thing (although only occasionally relevant):  
Actions: Can the user do real things? Accomplish work, not just absorb information?  
  
And you’re trying to arrange things with an anticipation of the user’s reaction to being presented with interfaces to make something that is intuitive and useful.  
  
AR is just a display technology, superimposing information over the real world. Even then, you have different flavors for additive light pass-through technologies like NReal/Hololens and AR in VR like the Quest3 and Apple Vision Pro.  
  
So even the display side isn’t something solid that you can distinctly quantify.  
  
But, to get to all the other boxes you’ve got to check, you’ve got to understand the input, user intent, and purpose, and all of those explode the number of possibilities and specific challenges related to each of the many AR ecosystems.  
  
Quest has controllers.  
Vision Pro uses hands & eye tracking.  

  
These completely change how you need to design for the platforms.  
  
If you’re just starting out, I’d say you should just pick some AR project on some accessible platform and get started.  
  
You can only really learn “what you don’t know that you don’t know” from experience, trying things, developing a familiarity with the industry.  
  
The initial question is too broad to be worth much. It’s sort of like saying “I’m an engineer struggling to learn cars, and trying to transition to cars. Where should I start?”  
  
If you were trying to get into cars, where would you start?  
  
Buy a car? Start going to car shows? Fix a car? Build a kit car?  
  
And, while I hope that metaphor communicates something of the extent that such a broad topic has no distinct start point, at least cars are fairly defined, as an industry, at this point. “AR” on the other hand is still evolving rapidly and hasn’t settled into any sort of distinct archetypes yet.  
  
So yeah, if you’re really interested, the only thing you can really do is start somewhere… anywhere. You’ve got a phone? You can do some AR on a phone? Want to get into head worn AR, get some sort of HMD, and start there.  
  
Get started, fail a lot, and you’ll eventually build an expertise.",
603,Stellar_atmospheres,"The fun and difficult thing about working with cutting edge technology is there are wayyy fewer resources to learn, because it's, well, new! The industry is also new. ""AR career"" isn't really a thing yet, everybody I know is either already a game dev, software engineer, artist, animator, or UX designer etc, who make AR alongside other multimedia projects.

While there are some great internet resources out there, you're just gonna have to figure some things out yourself, and learn according to your strengths. Depending on your current set of skills in design, I would recommend learning the principles of real-time rendering and maybe unity basics which will apply to anything AR regardless what software you use. Stuff like shaders, video game 3D pipeline, maybe behaviors in javascript if that's your jam.

Personally I don’t like the VR with passthrough that represents the Meta Quest and now the Apple Vision and have decided to focus on XR and AR with a HUD style focus. Perhaps you are more interested in the VR+passthrough segment, but for me I don’t see anything that complex for XR/AR HUD style approaches.

609,gaucho_celeste,"In my company we have UX designers (my team) and Visual designers. We both have a lot of overlap in terms of skills but differ in focus.

Then we have prototype engineers who work mostly in Unity. They take our UI/UX output and make quick prototypes that we can refine and iterate on.


Beyond them are the engineers who bring to life what the prototypers create. This realm is as obscure to me as I imagine design and usability is to you. In short, at this stage in your career, I would suggest leveraging your strengths in engineering.


If you’re serious about medical design then look into purchasing (or acquiring) and learning these standards: 

AAMI HE75 - humans factors engineering for medical design. Does not cover AR, but you can extrapolate.

IEC 62366 -  specifies usability requirements for the development of medical devices and interfaces.

I have a degree in CS and Biology but I've never worked in med tech, and I wasn't able to get any interviews in medical companies despite 3 years of AR UX development last job hunt round. It made me wonder if I need a masters or PhD in BME if I really want to enter medical AR.",
614,gaucho_celeste,"On your resume and portfolio you would state and demonstrate that your design process is compliant with 62366. In a nutshell, 62366 is all about risk mitigation; it outlines all the steps, and how to document your process, and concludes with a thorough usability evaluation. Compliant documentation is important because the FDA and other foreign regulatory agencies will be looking for that documentation. 

62366-1 is the actual guideline and -2 is examples. Very helpful

HE75 is a tool that helps you “pass” the usability evaluation portion of 62366. It is a smart reference to have even if you’re not doing medical design. Ever wonder how large to make a button, or how big text should be at X distance? It’s all in there.

There is no test, other than the interviewer testing your knowledge.

Meta spark: Is probably the easiest to deliver content since most people has Instagram in their phones, however has some limitations in experience size (5mb max) and tracking. They have implemented some interesting templates recently

Lens studio: it's has a wide variety of tracking capabilities, includes machine learning integration, cloth simulation, has a decently big size per experience (up to 25mb) and they are integration meshy AI (and AI the creates textures for 3d models) in their beta version. the downside is that the company is not in a good spot currently.

Effect house: the platform hasn't been out as long as the others, but they are constantly adding new features including cloth simulation in their most recent update, their experience size is about the same as meta spark (5mb) however is not the most user friendly platform (at least for windows version) 

8th wall: Is a quite versatile platform integrated for web AR, has interesting tracking options and allows the use of bigger size archives. The downside of the platform is the paywall",

This is an example of how this kind of thing only works in perfect scenarios, if it's all set up and ready to go and everything functioning and nothing needs updating.  In the real world, with real people who are panicking and out of date versions and incompatibilities and network outages and accounts and logins, it falls on its face.

There's plenty of interesting use cases for AR (industrial, work safety, etc) but no one is really moving on shifting up their infrastructure in a profoundly big way to support any of that just yet - likewise, even though the tech has been making decent strides, the lion's share of the design philosophies required to make it a really good experience are just far too immature. This will take several years to iterate, and unless Meta and Apple and etc keep pushing the needle hard (actually a fair bit more than they currently do, and that's not trying to sound critical) then it will keep moving at a relatively slow rate.

Anyway, that's ok. In spite of my tone, it's a really fascinating place to be right now (although quite difficult for those trying to make real money, yet). As I said the tech is coming along pretty great, and there is a budding community in and around AR. It's just gonna be awhile, but plenty of interesting/novel things are happening for those patient enough to hunt around and contribute. Definitely not ready for mass adoption yet, not by a long shot.

Generally I will say, the kids who grow up with this stuff being more available/""normal"" will take to it more as they grow up, and it will become a lot more meaningful and useful, and integrated into our society. Kind of like how video games kind of existed on the periphery (games and toys category) for a good few decades before it became more acceptable in the mainstream, big business, etc. Of course, with the way things move exponentially faster, I don't expect it to take QUITE that long, but it's not exactly 5 years out, either.",

The Memojis are 3D models which have what are called “blendshapes”, which is basically a state you want to model to be in with some smooth transitions between states. 

So you would model the character with wide open eyes and a mouth for the “shocked” blendshape. You would then model the eyes and mouth closed for a “sleep blendshape”. You make as many blendshapes as you want. The more the better. 

The blendshapes are then “weighted” so that a value of 1 for the mouth maps to the “open mouth blendshape” and a value of 0 maps to the “closed mouth blendshape”

Then you define the targets for the blendshapes in code. With AR, facial features are tracked in real time and mapped to values. A mouth open is 1, a mouth closed is 0. 

As the user opens and closes their mouth, the blendshape calculation occurs where those input numbers are applied to the blendshape weights.",

774,quaderrordemonstand,"I agree, competition is always good. At the same time though, I wish they had competing visions rather than just copying results. No reason Apple couldn't copy ideas from Meta, if Meta ever produced an idea worth copying.

I also agree that the ecosystem is a double edged sword. Apple has been carefully building up the developer infrastructure around AR for a while. They have a familiar platform that people trust and many are already invested in. So it reduces a lot of friction for those people.

But the downside is that its an isolated box. It's hard to move data into and out of it, and that is a large part of the potential use case for AR. You want everybody in a meeting to view a model in AVP? Then you're going to have to jump through more Apple shaped hoops than is really necessary.",

Sure Marketing is sophisticated enough these days that it can engineer Demand, where it is low or non existent.....if your starting point is a decent product. 

And the original iphones were great products. Way better than what passed for a phone in those day. The Demand Engineers were able to coast off that. Add to that, the top quality Financial Engineering (tax/labor cost/exchange rate/interest rate/govt subsidy arbitrage/supply chain optimization) that Tim Cook represents, and they were able to meet and boost Demand, no technologist or creative type inside Apple ever imagined. 

So we got to see Demand and Financial engineering running at a pace, faster than Technical and Creative innovation. But it was possible only cause the starting point was had a real magical feel too it.

But its hard for these products to replicate that moment. People are already overloaded on magic and novelty. They already have cheap high quality large ass screens.

911,0v3r_cl0ck3d,"For certain tasks Apple's hardware is significantly better. The Apple Silicon SoCs (M1, M2, M3) all have unified memory, which means that your GPU can access \*all\* of your CPU memory without any performance loss. On Windows if you need to access main system memory from the GPU you have to wait for data to be sent over PCIE which is a big bottle neck if you're doing it frequently.

&#x200B;

My work relies on heavy usage of compute shaders. When I switched from Windows to Mac I got a 10x performance boost in my workflow because I have 64 GB of RAM, which means my GPU has access to 64 GB of VRAM. Having everything in VRAM ready to go massively sped up the software that I use. Although calling it VRAM doesn't really make sense since Apple Silicon doesn't make a distinction between VRAM and RAM. It's just memory that both the CPU and GPU can access simultaneously.

&#x200B;

I can't imagine there are any VR apps that would benefit from this but the Vision Pro does also use Apple Silicon, the exact same chips used in Macs. That is one advantage the Vision Pro has over the Quest 3 since the Quest 3 uses discrete CPU and GPUs with their own memory.

&#x200B;

All this will probably change by the time the Quest 4 comes out though. Qualcom hired most of Apple's engineers after they finished designing the M1 and put them to work on the Snapdragon X SoC. Marketing materials say that it out-performs the M3 so we'll probably see that (or a future generation of it) in future Quest models.",
912,nucleartime,"Eh, as someone who doesn't own any Apple products personally, they do have a better than average level of polish, integration, and technical execution. The compatibility layer for Apple silicon has no business working as well as it does and their phone SoCs are basically a generation ahead of whatever Qualcomm has for basically every metric outside of GPU performance.

Or for a less technical example, if you have airpods and iphone, they pair just like that, no futzing with bluetooth settings. 

Of course, you try to do something Apple doesn't want you to do, and it's just like, nope, I'm out. Not worth the headache.

Isint it more, that competition is simply a way to waste resources?

The real big steps in human history, like theory of relativity. Was it because of competition?

Or how about alternating current? It was exactly competition that almost killed it, because a richer capitalist tried to prevent it. As it threated his profits.

Perhaps in the past when it first released. These days phones like the s24 are arguably the better product. With the AVP's features, tbh its hard to call it aspirational due to its many trade offs.

I don't know if this is necessarily true. A lot of companies take jabs at their competitor. [Nvidia towards AMD](https://www.techjuice.pk/nvidia-ceo-mocks-amds-new-gpu-calling-its-performance-lousy/), Microsoft towards Apple, Mercedes and Jaguar, Path of Exile mocking Diablo and so on.  Nvidia certainly doesn't see themselves in the number 2 position, and it has never been in the number 2 position. Neither is Diablo more successful in the current arpg space versus POE.

>With that video from Meta and with comments said earlier, they are positioning themselves to be the mass market low price choice for folks that can’t afford AVP.

Are they really? Zuck quite literally stated that he felt his product was better, **period**. Although he, and everyone else who looked at the price difference **initially, would automatically assume** that the Vision Pro is the far superior product merely based on the price, which if true, would make the Quest, indeed, the low price good value choice.

However, technically comparing them, **it's not true**. So, the AVP is only an *overpriced* choice at the moment, not something that technologically vastly outpaces the quest, so much that people only turn to the quest because of it's low price.

Note that the Samsung flagship phones **are not the mass market low price choice for folks that can't afford the iphone.** Just as Windows desktops are not the mass market low price choice for folks who ""can't afford a Mac"".

>they just don’t plan to ever compete on raw quality or performance. They’re conceding that to Apple

Again, I don't know if you watched the same video as me. Zuck says his product is better in quality in some metrics. He also mentioned that the eye tracking input was cool and he planned to integrate it into future models, even going as far as to mention neural interfaces.

>There are definitely trade offs and, for folks that have used neither and tries both, they will come away understanding how much nicer the AVP experience is even with the trade offs (indicating Apple’s made the right ones)

That is not what I have been reading regarding the AVP. A lot of people who've tried both do not agree that the experience as a whole is nicer. It just depends on the specific usage case.

For productivity and integration within the Apple product ecosystem it is without a doubt better.  For those who value immersion (FOV, Pixel Smearing, Comfort), the AVP is a strictly worse product. And yes, there are people who value that. It's why products like the very light bigscreen beyond or the pimax 200fov headsets exist at premium price points.

Again, I would agree with you if it's undisputed that the AVP is just better in every way but ""too expensive"" so people settle with the Quest.

However, that's just not true, and there are many reasons why someone would pick a Quest over an AVP, disregarding the price, and the reason is basically **gaming and entertainment purposes**.

The AVP is utterly and completely defeated in this aspect, even if it costs 7 times more. Meta has invested billions into immersive content and first party titles over the last decade, while Apple's ""VR(spatial computing)"" store is pretty barren at the moment. The metaverse, while not that great at the moment, far outstrips anything Apple has to offer in that space currently (basically nothing).

Same reason why many PC consumers with even a small interest in gaming, get windows PCs/laptops and not Mac products.

>Meta stands to make a LOT of money on being “second best AVP”.

They aren't ""second best AVP"". They are completely different in terms of target audience, just like how Apple computers and Windows computers are marketed to users with difference usage needs.

Again, you are completely bamboozled by the premium price point that Apple has set. ""it is so much more expensive, thus it must be better"". This statement simply isn't true in the VR space. The bigscreen beyond is more than 2 times the price of the Quest 3, but it's lens quality and therefore visual fidelity is much worse due to glare, which is a tradeoff they made for the form factor.

The Quest 3 is not cheap because it uses lousier technology. It is cheap because it is very well cost optimized and subsidized to get VR into the hands of the masses, and is even better than headsets like the Vive that cost more.",

People don’t usually highlight price differences to say “we’re more expensive” they do so to say “we’re less expensive”. Well, that‘s what they usually say. Companies don’t generally say their stuff is “cheaper” because that carries a more negative meaning than “less expensive”. But, I’m not Zuck, if he wants to say his stuff is cheaper, then it’s fine by me. :)

Zuckerberg said his product is better, but he’ll be implementing some of the new product’s features into his product. “My product is better in every way, but I’m going to copy the features of a product that’s worse than my own.” Ok?

Meta says the company hopes its Quest headset could become the Google Android of the metaverse. Now, maybe they shouldn’t have let whoever said this say it. Maybe they should have prepared a statement that said, “We want to be the headset that everyone thinks of when they think VR, when they think XR, when they think immersive experiences that change people’s lives!” Though wildly campy, it would STILL have been *way* better than, “You see how Android basically copied the look and feel of the iPhone while being cheaper and not-Apple?

There are 3 other chips in that lineup, each more powerful than the one before it. Those are the M2 Pro, M2 Max, and M2 Ultra. The M2 Ultra which is what's referenced in the link you posted is only in their workstations (the Mac Studio and Mac pro). If you double check the link you posted it says the Ultra has 76 GPU cores.

So yeah, that chip specifically does have similar performance to the 4080, but it's also a much bigger and more power hungry chip than the M2 in AVP. In fact it's actually two M2 Max chips connected together which is pretty cool I guess.",

The Vision Pro, if you’re an Apple user already, integrates with EVERYTHING. Your reminders, notes, email, messages, tabs, bookmarks, photos, purchased movies, music library, your Mac.

So for example, I can go take 3D photos and videos of a birthday using my iPhone, then put on my AVP and they’re already there, waiting to be viewed. Get a text while viewing, look up and tap the notification, and respond right in the headset. Then pull up my Mac display to work in Photoshop with a single tap (on a 20 foot screen). Do all of that alongside my music library and playlists hovering open in midair right next to it. FaceTime someone and see what they’re doing. They share their view and I’m watching them play an AR game. Pin that up on the wall next to me while I check a new email that just came in. Add some things to my shopping list, which are immediately synced to my phone. So you never have to take the headset off to do anything on your phone or PC, and when you do take it off and head out, everything you’ve done is already up to date on your other devices and it’s all with you wherever you go.

I’m not even sure if the base M2 chip has three USB4 transceivers.

Plus you’ve got the CPU in somebody’s pocket up against their 95 degree body, with essentially no airflow.

If more sensors are added or the CPU is upgraded, the battery, cable, and the headset needs to be reworked.

And if somebody’s battery pack gets damaged due to the excessive heat, it’s a nominally ~$1000 part instead of $200.

And ultimately the overall heat/power consumption is probably significantly more because you need to drive multiple video streams up and down the entire length of the cable plus add components to demux the signal out to the individual components in the headset.

Samsung has the potential but until they decide to treat VR or AR as a standalone platform instead of add-ons for their phones, don’t see them bothering even if they could.

Note that 2015 also saw the advent of the Hololens, while Google Glass (which was a trash experience) came in 2011.

The Quest series brought around the first device that could do AR in a headset well with the Quest Pro and to more people with the Quest 3, and so Apple actually lost out on their claim to create the first consumer mixed reality device.  

Finally, Feb 2024 the Vision Pro is released.  Invented what now? They have assembled an interesting piece of technology with higher quality than the Quest and spurned the use of the reality terms, instead opting for the term spatial computing, but note that the Quest had hand tracking and eye tracking and did everything that the Vision Pro does, just not as well.

What Apple always brings to the table is a high quality OS with developer oriented tools.  The Quest relied heavily on Unity (so did the Hololens) and android, and positioned itself more in games.

1206,keiranlovett,"Did Apple claim they invented the term? No.

Here’s the thing with Apple. They _brand_ their products. Apple is “the great marketer”. Almost every tool or technology Apple makes will have some marketing name given to it, that identity then gives it a life larger than its own. There’s many psychological reasons for this but the gist is it helps differentiate in the competition. Make yourself stand out! 

Spatial Computing is an existing term that Apple _branded_ a product around. A product which _has now just launched_. Therefore it is “the first time” a customer will use the product. 

This is trying to make a mountain out of ant hill. 

Now… one could argue that the Vision Pro IS the first “Spatial Computer” because it seems to be the first VR headset to function largely _as a modern computer_ would to an average user. It provides all the basic features and functionality of computer in which the UX is dictated by _spatial interfaces_ and more real world interactions (core tenants of virtuality and spatial design). For the likes of Vive, Oculus, and Quest - these headsets were single application experiences. The HoloLens comes close but I would think it falls short of being a computer as well due to the limits of system (last time I wore it you could barely do anything productive).",
1207,quaderrordemonstand,"Let's establish parameters. I'm not saying that everything that Apple ever did was a product you would invest in. What you should invest in and who invents are entirely different subjects. This is about useable, not investable.

As for pretentious, actually its quite the opposite. Being usable is about focusing entirely on the practical use case. Pretension would be focusing on what you want to think the use case should be rather than what it really is.

Still, debating pretension is kind of irrelevant. Apple have introduced ideas focused around usability that nobody did before. That is fact. None of the technologies involved were invented by Apple, its all about how those technologies are used. You can call that pretension all you like, it will still be fact.",

The Apple Watch is the most successful selling watch ever…not the most successful “Smart Watch”, but actual “watch”.

Don’t need to be a “fanboy” to see that there’s a reason they’re one of the most valuable tech companies to this day.

But alright, let’s bite on your argument. When it comes to manufacturing VR/AR hardware, the industry has admitted very clearly that its growth and maturity is dependant on the mobile industry. At its most simplistic, reductionist view…VR headsets are mobile phones glued to your face, so these headsets have to source their hardware from mobile manufacturers. 

Apple has demonstrated experience in the following:
- reducing hardware footprint to ridiculous levels,
- designing high resolution displays with low thermals,
- integrating software and hardware together for a cohesive experience.

Tim Cook's literal tweet message: ""We’re so excited for you to experience spatial computing for the first time!""

They literally said they would never use the term ""Metaverse"" publicly, completely refuse to use the phrase AR/VR at all, tell 3rd party developers they cannot utter those words, and instead use a term pretty much nobody else in the industry did. Come on, what do you think is going on here?? Wheter explicitly or implciitly, you don't think they're trying to get the average Joe who has never heard of these phrases to assume Apple is doing something new and different?

Facebook should get shit for regranding AR/VR and gaming into Metaverse and Apple should get shit for pretending they are different because they do ""spatial computing"" instead, it's the same shit.

>Your argument that Apple has absolutely nothing to contribute to the space

Never said anything of the sorts.

>The claim that Apple is a one trick pony really illustrates how ill informed you are. The Apple Watch is the most successful selling watch ever…not the most successful “Smart Watch”, but actual “watch”

Success in sales does not prove they are not a one-trick pony. Supreme sold really well, NFTs sold really well, Prime sells really well, doesn't mean they have anything real to offer that others didn't already. This is not a subreddit about stocks.

>The AirPods product alone generates more revenue than the entirety of Spotify as a business.

Again, numbers don't matter. Just because they can get people to buy a new phone each year, doesn't mean people actually need it. It's marketing, they're marketing machine is so powerful they can turn people like you into fanboys who defend them online for free.

>If you download the Gemini app or opt in through Google Assistant, you'll be able to access it from the app or anywhere else you normally activate Google Assistant — hitting the power button or corner swiping on select phones, or saying “Hey Google.” This will enable a new overlay experience that offers easy access to Gemini as well as contextual help right on your screen — so you can, for instance, generate a caption for a picture you've just taken or ask questions about an article you're reading.

Being a developer I’ve always thought of developers as the modern day wizards, creating magic for the world. I’ve imagined bringing them and myself unlimited computing. The real productivity powerhouse that helps us with multiple computers controlling them all quickly and easily. The Apple Vision Pro is getting even closer to that real possibility, but I wanted something more open, and more cross platform. So I’ve set upon building that, and we’ve got an alpha release for cross platform allowing you to control multiple computers with Virtual monitors.

Advancements regarding the screen itself will likely come from AI rather than XR, with features like summarizing an entire post with all the comments into a few lines of highlights, etc.

A more Sci Fi idea that I came up with for a book I'm writing is an internet browser that shows not just one page at a time, but all the pages at once, along with relationships between them in terms of traffic, one page being opened after another in sequence etc, being represented by distance between them.

Consider once more the idea of simulating comments as AR segments. This would inspire commenters to be more colorful in wording, just to specifically provoke the language/spatial model. The problem is in ensuring the comments remain relevant to the main post. The issue bubbles upward to maintaining the coherence of the entire platform itself. A solution is quick models trained on single posts, exclusively made available to commenters on the post. All the context comes from the comment, post, and, if the reader pleases, other comments on the post.",

1328,adhoc42,"There's probably room for both. I think the idea that you're describing fills a need, albeit a different one from what's currently filled by indulging in text-based media. It could be more similar to places where use of emojis has become common, like one-to-one text messages or image-focused platforms like tumblr. Your description also reminds be a bit of VR Chat, which admittedly is an amazing platform with tons of potential.",
1329,kabamendu,"I can accept that. You're quite on point with new kinds of emojis using AI simulations. I do think it should be taken more seriously than emojis, however. How exactly does VR chat relate? I was under the impression that it's just chat in VR. I'll do my research on it later if needed.",
1330,adhoc42,"If Reddit can be described as an asynchronous chatroom, then perhaps  ""comments as AR segments"" can be described as asynchronous VR Chat, where the OP selects an environment, and avatar for themselves, and uses their voice and motion gestures to initiate a topic. All of that is then recorded and other people can view it. If they choose to respond to it with their voice and gestures, they will also appear in the room with their own avatars for others to see, and so on. I'm not sure if this is what you were originally thinking of, it's just where my mind went.",
1331,kabamendu,"+1 for ""async sims."" The problem is that the relevance of comments to the post will be hard to maintain. If that's a problem with text-based comments, it'll a war with simulation-based comments. Rather, the nature of these simulations must be solely determined by a combination of the comment, some pre-defined and mods-approved text summary of the commenter, and the post's content. The visuals of the simulation should strive to primarily represent the post with consideration for the general preferences of the commenter. If the post was about how archaeologists recently discovered a long lost king's tomb, a part of your room, through the vision pro, would render a living, breathing, holographic representation of archaeologists digging out the tomb. However, if the comment from which the sim is generated says something like, ""your mama is older than that king,"" the hologram would probably show a king with feminine features and the archaeologists kissing his hands and acting chivalrous or something like that. (Depends on model training.) In a way, it's like newspapers comics or political cartoons. The point is that arbitrariness is successfully curbed on the platform. Even more important is that spatial readers of posts would get a sensual and fuller feel of the stances of commenters and the larger subreddit community, based on the intrigue or seriousness or comedic quality of the rendered holograms. This is what I think will make adhoc simulations more respectable than emojis - removing the room for extreme arbitrariness. The models behind the simulations are very domain-specific, limited by the world spelled by the posts and the larger subreddit.",

I'm actually playing around with something right now using OpenCV and Tesseract(think object/text recognition), and used my laser to cut out a small wooden ""magnifying glass"" with a viewing hole in it and some fun designs on it.

The idea is that the kids can wear a set of funny looking frames with a small camera feeding the visual data to a small device(maybe a bookmark or reading stand) and only the text in the window will be read aloud.  Kind of an interesting way to practice sight reading(at least in my head lol).

I've got most of it working, but still a ways to go.

For the resources, he gets Speech, Occupational, ABA(I know it's kind of controversial to some, but we monitor sessions closely and have it to help him learn basic life skills), and PT.

Maybe a game that can help with OT or PT? Like augmented reality models leading an easy exercise routine or again, life skills things? 

Off rip, maybe just a virtual ""calming"" sensory environment with colors and sounds that you can supplement with physical feedback.",

1372,adL-hdr,Technology not yet baby,
1373,totesnotdog,"So with transparent glass displays they use what is called wave guide displays they are effectively bouncing projected light into your eyes. Much like HoloLens 2, but the downside to this is there is no such thing as black light. Only tinted white light. So wave guide displays render black as transparent and can only go so dark with certain colors meaning that another downside is they cannot blend realistic darks of shadows of the AR projections they do. 

This is why you see richer shadows on MR pass through on mixed reality devices that don’t use wave guide displays. I also assume apple is aware of that limitation of wave guides and chose screen pass through instead.

Edit: personally I like getting to use wave guide displays and would be down for some AR glasses that used them but the reality is they wouldn’t be able to do such rich dark colors and there may be some subtle transparency on stuff with really bright backgrounds but this isn’t really all that bad. As long as the projections are bright enough they usually pop well agains the background unless the background is extremely bright too.

For that times your device should be in the list which supports that functionality. After that you have iOS and Android phones, for each of them different platform - for example one software supporting only iOS, other only Samsung flagman's.  
Platform allowing to make this on both iOS/Android - will cost some money for your business, for example each scan 1cent for you. So if you willing to make such idea few years ago you definitely have no chance to reach all business due platform support.

I have eye sickness so I ordered prescription lense but in the meantime I juste wore my glasses beside the xreal. Not very comfortable but it works.

Working on computer is good but you need a computer with a USB c which allow video stream (USB-C with D port compatibility)

I did not try the nebula app to have multiple screen. I just tested to have a second screen ""in the air"" and I was able to work 1h comfortably.

The first session was difficult to understand how everything works and my eyes was easily tired. But now I get used to it and everything is smooth.

Also, looking at video on YouTube or Netflix on the bed with those is wonderful(or playing the switch in the bed).

I also use the x real beam to stream a YouTube video on a corner of the glasses while I was cleaning up the kitchen. It worked well but I sometike was afraid that the glasses would fell when I bend over.

However, HoloLens team was laid off (bad) and their responsibilities absorbed within Windows Core (unlikely to be cancelled), combined with the US Military moving forward with their Mixed Reality project that has been rocky to say the least.

But… there are much better hardware platforms coming that also adopt LIDAR, have better quality sensors, and have easier software development.

For MR( AR+VR), Apple seems do not just define Vision Pro as MR mechine because it overlaps with Quest3. Quest 3 is kind of a game console but VSP is more related to ""work"". so I think this is why they call VSP 'spacial computer'. It is also a kind of marketing method.",

While I don't personally use it for work, you can easily link a Bluetooth keyboard to the headset and use one of the many office work-oriented apps that have released in Quest stores. It's just a matter of companies adapting their workspaces to using AR/VR/MR headsets for computer work.

In short, yes, you can replace your computer with the Quest 3 depending on what you're using it for. Quest 3 can fully replace your computer in terms of casual Internet use and basic computer work.

Hardware is one thing that’s capping the tech’s adaptation, but to me it’s more about the lack of “data”: there’s not much data in the world that’s suited for spatial interface, or at least, without building it from scratch.

My work is usually 80% data discovery/collection, although clients think that I’m making cool UI.

AR has huge potential in E-commerce, advertising and gaming, but probably too expensive for small and mid companies.

Would recommend to search for AR job market reports, you will see the trends and analysis for current and future situation. 

From PWC report:

Globally, the impact of VR and AR on employment over the next decade will be significant. Currently, fewer than a million jobs are impacted by VR and AR and this will rise to 23 million jobs by 2030, with the biggest impact in large economies like China, the US, the UK, Germany.

It has a bit lower resolution than the MagicLeap but a higher Field of View, so maybe it's good enough for viewing 3D models as holograms, although I never tried it so I cannot tell. It requires to be wired to a computer and to have a special board/mat of reflective material that comes with the glasses to be sitting on top of a table, but if you don't mind these then it may be something worth looking into as it has a program for viewing 3d files as holograms:

I think the platform with the least update is Snapchat with Lens Studio. I don't know about EffectHouse but SparkAR requires updates and maintenance every few months or so, sometimes they allow you to just update it in one click while other times where they have a big update, you'll need to open it in a new version and just re-export it.

I'm not sure about how Adobe Aero updates though, but as far as I'm using it, it doesn't require any updates so far, so I guess that'll be your best bet. We're using these companies services anyways so it's always possible for their services to be nonexistent if they went bankrupt.",

Furthermore, I am not an ""advocacy"" of Unity, I just use it because it's better for AR Development right now, based on my Experience of Creating [complete AR Projects](https://makaka.org/ar).

# Performance

Unity can be run on every machine for development. When I tried to experiment with Unreal, I faced with high requirements for hardware for a standard 3rd-person scene.

So Unreal, is not suitable for medium and weak laptops in long-term development (especially for video recording of your screen at the same time if you need it), but Unity suits: at the moment of Unity 2022.3 — relevant version for now for production.

# Testing

With Unity AR Foundation 5 and its [XR Simulation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@5.1/manual/xr-simulation/simulation.html), you can test AR apps right in Unity Editor. If you need fast testing with a real device experience, so there are [some Unity Assets](https://makaka.org/unity-tutorials/ar-testing) you can use.

# WebGL

You mentioned websites. The AR Foundation doesn't support websites for now, but you can use WebGL with the [next Unity Assets](https://forum.unity.com/threads/ar-for-webgl-with-unity.1412541/).",

1793,BootsyRootsy,"It's definitely achievable! And I feel you pain, knowing what you want to do and wandering out into the constantly shifting sands of AR programming and implementation.

A few years ago my MRP (Masters Research Project) I needed to build an AR prototype experience. So many platforms, so much expertise needed... what to choose? I found YouTube tutorials that demonstrated how to build the functionality I needed in Unity and I was able to realize my vision... I NEVER could have gotten there without the tutorials!

But then came the 'distribution' part (this was in 2019). Publish an app that people would then have to download? Nobody wants to download an app, especially standing at a table amid fifty other presentations just to see one thing. So I made a video recording (screen recording) of the functionality running in Unity and presented THAT - my presentation board had still pictures taken from the video recording, the physical model (scale model of a park) that triggered and anchored the AR was sitting on the table. I published the video to Vimeo and generated a QR code that 'pointed' to it. I printed the QR code and put it on the table beside the model. When people scanned the code it opened the video RECORDING that I had made in Unity of the functionality working - they saw the AR experience, but it wasn't actually 'happening' in their phones. Still, with the model sitting there, it was enough for them to ""ooh"" and ""aah"".

The technologies have updated a LOT since then, and it's much, much easier to model and implement an AR experience. I'm in the same spot you are (again), working on my PHD dissertation which extends what I did in my masters. Once again, I've been navigating the various technologies to figure out how to build my experience. I can do a video recording demo of the functionality again, but there has been a major development that means nobody has to download an app - **new smartphones can do AR right in the web browser, and you can trigger it/download the content through a QR code**. This is, of course, a much more interactive and impressive way to go. I am still researching it myself; maybe we can 'buddy up' on findings. Start by googling ""AR in web smartphone browser HTML5"".

But to catch you up, here's what I've found so far:

1. This company is doing a good job. Go here [https://ar-code.com](https://ar-code.com) and use your phone's camera to scan their demo codes on that first page. They operate on a subscription model, of course.

The Google (Android) and Apple (iPhone) ""kits"" that allow the functionality are free, and there are lots of articles, demos and tutorials on how to build the HTML5 yourself. Things like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v\_Uj0C8sMi4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_Uj0C8sMi4) I've only started figuring this stuff out, but it looks promising. I will likely try to build my own thing, but if it gets too frustrating I'll end up picking one of the many, many AR building and publishing platforms and paying. I may end up trying Unity again, but that's not a very friendly piece of software if you don't use it all the time like a game developer or something.

SO! The good news is that AR implementation and publishing is available to people like you and me now (non expert, non programmers). The even better news is that new smartphones can experience what we make without downloading an app, just by scanning a QR code (which is easy to generate for free) that points to a webpage you've published, the AR happening via HTML5.

There are a lot of people in this sub that actually know what they're doing. Hopefully somebody will read what I've written here and point us to something even better and free (or really affordable).",

1973,realityPioneer,"A bit hard to answer specifically without more details. A JS developer could learn enough Unity to get a project up and running in an hour — or it could take years depending on the complexity of the work. Unity’s initial learning curve is manageable but it’s got a long tail. 

This is especially true for AR, where there’s a lot of nuance and difficulty that’s not specific to Unity. But again, this is highly dependent on the app itself. An AR app to place a miniature model on a table is pretty straightforward, but one that has high-accuracy spatial alignment at building scale is much, much harder. And you’re likely to have to use a 3rd party SDK to achieve that, depending on your requirements.

What device(s) are you targeting? That influences all of your questions as well. Unity is generally a great framework for AR, and very likely you can achieve your goal with it. But beyond that it’s hard to make any intelligent recommendation around tech stack without a deeper dive.",

The problem is that devices don't currently have built-in functionality to load 3D content without either using the browser or a custom app.

See [http://qrcode.meetheed.com/qrcode\_examples.php](http://qrcode.meetheed.com/qrcode_examples.php). Many people have phones that will display these basic data types after scanning a QR code, but they are not what you need.

Having said that, there's a company [https://ar-code.com/](https://ar-code.com/) that's trying to cater to experiences kind of like what you want. I've never used it, but it looks like their default experience won't keep the reader in the flow the way you want. Still, you might want to check it out, or even reach out to them. They might be able to give you tips on how to best incorporate their solution.

See also this page: [https://ar-code.com/blog/how-do-i-scan-ar-codes](https://ar-code.com/blog/how-do-i-scan-ar-codes)

&#x200B;

Alternatively, I suspect you need a custom app to create the best experience. But you may not have the resources to do that for a student project?

I'm envisioning a custom app running with the camera pointed at the book, like with a phone mounted on a stand. A headset could work better if you can assume that for your audience. The user would open the app when they start reading the book. The app would continuously scan the pages for some cue, like QR codes, and render the appropriate 3D character in AR whenever it detects a cue.

Nevertheless, for a student project, you might be better off using the camera to scan QR codes and load the content from a website. It won't be as smooth, but I suspect it will be more doable to set up a custom website to host your 3D content. Just simple pages for each character with a ""View in AR"" button. Or using AR Code would be even less smooth, but easier. Which is helpful since I assume the art will be a lot of work already.

Of course if you can get a skilled app developer to help you, that might change the calculation.",

2224,Dudevid,"I'm someone who has spent years in all these spaces except fashion design. This is a very diverse set of interests so I can only provide very high-level advice:

1. Graphics programming: amazing if you love art and have a technical background, but it might be more maths focused than merely 'technology'. How're your maths skills lookin'? Specifically geometry, trig, vector spaces, linear algebra, and some aspects of probability/statistics (e.g. noise patterns, Gaussian distributions)? This stuff is eminently learnable and so much fun to learn if you also love maths. And highly rewarding too if you're of an artistic bent and achieve something you visualised that at first was seemingly impossible.
2. Full-stack web dev: yeah, I think you've already realised this isn't for you. High paid careers are available if you pursue this but it's unlikely to pay off if you also want to explore 3D art. There are some high-paid jobs and rewarding careers out there exploring 3D art on the web and the space is expanding with things like Three.js and WebGL but this is a riskier option if you want to pay the bills and live well, at least right now.
3. UX: the explosion of UX as a field in the late noughties/early 2010s meant that a designer's mind coupled with a psychologist's knack for user motivations constituted an individual likely to find a promising career, but again UX was until fairly recently centred around web dev/design. And I don't think web dev is for you.
4. VR UX: this is a really exciting field, and so much around VR with regards to UX remains fairly unestablished. Simple UX questions around how to rotate viewpoints in VR, how to translate in VR, how to interact with VR worlds which adapt to existing human spaces like homes etc. are _still_ entirely up for grabs. If you are technical and artistic but also demonstrate aptitude when it comes to rapid prototyping new UX schemes in a fairly nascent medium, then you will find a rewarding career here.
5. AR UX: this is related to VR UX, but there's a crucial difference I think. AR is the future UI of AI. If you're interested in advancements of AI, there will be an explosion of (speaking generally here) new tools, utilities, quality of life upgrades. More and more, as we humans learn to live with the future of AI, we will look for ways to integrate it into our lifes to benefit us in the lowest friction way. The lowest friction integration is for it live in the world with us.

I would ask you to consider AR UX, but I acknowledge that initially your design thirst may be unquenced. For ultimate art thirst quenching coupled with solid technical understanding, I'd say go with graphics programming. Finally, I would ask you to consider a career in video games, potentially even starting a new studio. That's what I did. Games needs almost all of the above.",
2225,kuesaaa,"hey there, sounds like you're into the creative problem solving side of things. have you considered looking into game design programs? combining your love for 3D art and technology with a focus on VR/AR could set you up for a solid career in a growing industry. good luck with your decision!",

2227,Formal_Salt2667,"Thanks for such a thorough reply!

I love to create things from concept upwards, thats what I find hugely rewarding which is why I loved being a character concept artist (did this for 6 months for childrens books)  I was given the story script and i came up with the designs. I enjoyed full stack web dev because of the creative problem solving and the logic of it but it felt too boxed-in when it came to coding for other people because it wasn't my concept or idea. When I worked in fashion design, again I loved the problem solving but the designs were always dictated to me by management/clients. The only time I felt free with it was at university when I could conceptualise and create. I used to use 3D modelling software as a fashion designer (APEX and CLO) which I found interesting too. To answer your question about maths, I was good at it at school but didn't find it engaging until university when I needed it for fashion design! I loved that problem solving to create the image in my mind irl.

&#x200B;

I've done some research on UX and the general consensus seems to be that it can get quite monotonous because theres only so much variation to a website or app layout. Plus the concept is already dictated. So I'm starting to question this route.

&#x200B;

I am super interested in games and the VR/AR world within that! I want to make sure I pick a future-proof degree that won't lead me into another oversaturated market (like fashion and junior web devs) because there are so many artists out there and not as many that can do both technical and arty.

1. Devices: AR only requires your smartphone - now mobile are built-in with the tech to experience AR. When it comes to MR, you need additional device like headsets (similar to VR)
2. Experience wise: While AR is more accesible ... it's less immersive. MR allow you to jump to ""another world"" without disconnecting from the real one

Did I answer your question?",
2254,GroundedSkeptic,Mostly true minus the magic leap 2,
2255,c1u,"the dream AR hardware is not just not good enough, it has *not been invented yet*.",
2256,STUDYXR_,Yeah! Same feeling here. Do you think people would actually wear AR glasses outside their homes?,
2257,STUDYXR_,"Agree! what do you mean with ""The ceiling for mixed reality is much much lower than for augmented reality""??",
2258,morfanis,"> Also the only device we really have at the moment is phones

You also have the Quest 3. The phone is passthrough in the same way the Quest 3 is passthrough.

Most people equate AR with see through AR, but passthrough AR is also a valid form of AR. 

Mixed Reality as it's originally defined encompasses both AR and Augmented Virtuality. When a headset has MR, it includes AR (ignoring the whole Microsoft MR labelling here).

See: [https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Reality%E2%80%93virtuality_continuum](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Reality%E2%80%93virtuality_continuum)",
2259,STUDYXR_,It seems that the barrier for MR to grow faster is device wise. Do you have any device to experience MR?,
2260,STUDYXR_,price point is indeed much needed. do you think MR devices would become as popular as smartphones in like 10years? Think about the first smartphone back in those days,

i made a summary to what i understand are the main 2 differences on a comment bit earlier",
2262,STUDYXR_,It all feels similar but the terminology is different. simplifying to AR is maybe easy for people who are not familiar but... if we get techie haha we should make the distinction,
2263,STUDYXR_,exactly! one no additional cost to buy a headset as Meta Quest 3 or Apple Vision pro (for those who can afford it),
2264,STUDYXR_,"which one is better?

1. Magic Leap 2
2. Meta Quest 3

Curious to know which one is the winner for you all",
2265,STUDYXR_,"it thin this is the first step to a more wearable version. Apple vision Pro seems a bit better design wise but too ""big"" to wear it outside your home no?",
2266,Seek_Treasure,"Of course they will when the hardware is there. I would certainly use AR at least for navigation and to learn what I'm looking at. And I'm sure other killer use cases will come soon after. 

There's a huge elephant in the room regarding privacy. But I'm generally optimistic about this too. Everyone now has a phone that can shoot very high quality video from large distance anyway.",
2267,CloudlessRain-,"I see mixed reality as a stop gap solution while we wait for true AR. 

Someday we'll have AR gear that has at least 75° field of vision, good quality 6° of freedom tracking, relatively lightweight and good looking, and priced well under $1,000. When that day arrives mixed reality will basically disappear, It will no longer have a niche in the marketplace.",
2268,ajm1212,"That’s totally true , but I guess I was thinking about it as everyday use like on the go.",
2269,STUDYXR_,"it's actually build in unity with the AR kit, isn't it?",
2270,ajm1212,Occulus Quest 2,
2271,wigitty,"I think AR could replace smartphones as a ""keep on you at all times and use throughout the day"" sort of device. In my mind, MR would be too isolating / antisocial to wear throughout the day, so wouldn't replace a smartphone, but would have its place in gaming and productivity, so could replace a monitor for a desktop.

So yes, I think both have the potential to become popular (maybe not quite smartphone popular just because no everyone can use them because of motion sickness and stuff), but they will have to hit the right form factor, price point, and offer good enough apps to make people want them.",
2272,ActionJ2614, [XR Today - XR Industry News - Extended Reality News](https://www.xrtoday.com/)  this site is worth checking out.,
2273,wilmaster1,"Definitely agreeing with you there. I should have specified that in day to day talk I mingle them, but in a technical discussion having a distinction is indeed important.
It is hard though, I work with developers, researchers, and non techies, and many have their own description on the exact meaning, or don't use it at all.
What would you call MR? Curious what fellow entheusiasts/techies group under the MR term.",
2274,GroundedSkeptic,"For AR, hands down Magic Leap 2.   You can see plenty of videos of the passthrough MR of Quest3 not looking great. Supposedly poor lighting conditions but idk, I’ve tried different lighting.",
2275,realityPioneer,"I think “better” in this case really depends on the use-case. Not only how critical real world vs virtual fidelity is (e.g., the ML2 does much better than the Quest 3 with the real world since it’s not pass through, but you lose some graphical capabilities around the virtual).  Form factors are also very different and influence which is a better fit for a given use.",
2276,STUDYXR_,"I see your point. I believe we'll use AR devices in the future as we use smartphone now. Regarding privacy, Apple Vision Pro mention during their announcement some fuctionality to show that you're recording a video. Something that right now it's not available on iphones ... so i think privacy is even more consider with AR glasses, dont you think so?",
2277,STUDYXR_,What do you mean with AR gear? like AR glasses?. I'm having a hard time understanding myself if in general when we talk about AR wearable devices aren't we talking about MR actually?,
2278,STUDYXR_,What's the experience? would you recommend it?,
2279,STUDYXR_,I use MR for Mixed Reality and XR for Extended Reality. Adapting and simplifying vocabulary depending on your audience is important ;),

2281,InternetofTings,"I've always hated the term Mixed Reality (MR) i thought 'XR' killed that term and i'm not a fan of that either.

Mixed Reality does seem to be making a comeback (press wise), but Mixed Reality always seemed more of a marketing term to me rather than an actual tech, the true tech names are VR and AR.",
2282,CloudlessRain-,"Imo there's only one big distinction that matters. Are we talking about partially transparent lenses that allow you to see the world directly through the lenses like the magic leap, or are we talking about a video pass through like the quest 3.

I call the magic leap ""AR"" and the quest 3 ""MR."" I guess other people don't use the terms the way I do, but there doesn't seem to be a consensus on what these actually mean.",
2283,ajm1212,"Yea, but they came out with the Occulus Quest 3 so I would go for the latest one",

2354,wigitty,"The idea would be that you would have one master application that managed the scene, and then smaller plugins that you could load into the master application. You can load models, textures and what not from files at runtime, so that bit should be easy. I haven't looked into the code side of it yet. Theoretically you could pre-compile all of the code for your plugin, and then load the compiled code into the master application at runtime, but I'm not sure if that is actually possible in Unity. If that's not possible, you could implement a scripting language such as Lua, and expose important internal functions. You could then load the scripts from text files at runtime and basically have a script in the master application that just goes ""if the script says move an object, then execute this code that moves an object"", etc.

I think in theory you could then make it a more ""complete"" experience by make the master app a launcher (the app that handles homescreens and launching apps in Android, which is user replaceable), and then provide a way for individual apps to send data to it to set up 3D models and scripts and stuff. This would basically turn an android device into a device that works as you described (you would probably also want to make sure standard applications could be launched and appear as a window in the scene). I don't plan to take things that far though, I would be happy with just an application that I could extend at runtime with plugins.",

A real killer app would be to sync two or more pairs together so when my spouse and I are watching the same movie at the same time it would play the same on both, if one of us pauses they both would. Also, I would like an option to fix the screen on a wall so the experience would be just like watching TV, turn my head and the screen stays where it was, not following my head everywhere I turn. I am close to pulling the trigger on a 75"" OLED but if I could get smart glasses that are comfy and can work like this I would probably never buy a real TV again.",

2403,Excellent_Fee_9597,Steering toward everyday use there is most likely so many startup opportunities from building certain apps to technical upgrades. Sadly I wouldn’t even know where to start. Ima security systems technician by trade so I have very basic knowledge of IT and code. I do have some very good ideas when it comes to certain apps ect but I wouldn’t know how to build them,
2404,EmergencyAd8321,"I am with you there. I’ve been interested in this space for a while. There are too many to choose from. There’s a podcast called the “AR Show” which has great content and gives some insight into the AR market as a whole. 
From the hardware standpoint I think Apple is going the hardest, so place some stock in Apple as a general measure.  The sleeping giant is Instagram (Meta) with software, but they curate and censor content on their platforms so there’s no real customization and will stifle creativity. Unless you like to put puppy dog eyes and knowing what Simpson character you are, the socials look like they won’t go that far as far as software usage for the masses.  Both of these are expensive to invest in and won’t give as much of a return on investment as the market cap is already pretty extended. If I had invested earlier than I did, I would be way better off. Although investment in the big names in the AR space will ultimately give a return, most of them don’t have much of an ROI anymore unless you already have a ton of money and day trade. 
Cobalt futures are worth a look as the battery consumption space will take off when we have the cable free eyewear. 
As far as startups, there are a couple that I’m looking into for my portfolio. One called Glyph that can place textures on virtually any object and allows for the digital content to bend with the material, even if it’s torn apart or at an odd and perpendicular angles.  Although the actual physical object has all these little “scales” in them that look like polkadots. Not sure it will be advantageous for the mass consumer but it’s a game changer for prototyping and seeing what objects would look like with customization in showroom settings. I’m waiting for them to open an investment round. 
The other startup I came across is called PublishAR who seems to be where the industry would be heading for public adoption in marker based AR. Users choose any tangible image and place digital content on it by pressing a button. They did a live demo really quick on stage at a tech event in San Diego.  They were demonstrating it for ad agencies and general user home photography/print products. If this one takes off, it could be huge. They are opening a pre-seed round in December, so I’m going to throw a few bucks at it. Maybe think about hitting these two up? I think they both have legs and are different from everything I’ve seen in the AR space.

I taught myself the Unity UI system, UMG in unreal and MRTK in unreal and Unity and MRTK 3 in Unity. It’s all just toolkits. 

That being said as long as the designer communicates with the devs well they should be able to insure their designs are integrated perfectly but I personally try to pay close attention to their wireframes and pixel counts and spacing between letters.

2455,xr_melissa,"I recently saw a designer showing off a cool looking concept of a 3D object emerging from the movie screen so the user could look at and manipulate it. It was a cool interaction—like extracting a piece of the movie to touch with your own hands! But it made me question some things.

Wouldn't that direct your attention away from the movie? What value does spinning a 3D object in front of you add to the experience?

It certainly depends on the exact use case (which I'm happy to discuss!). But in my case, I wanted to look at this idea from the standpoint of how 3D objects (or ""augments"" in Meta terms) would enhance the immersion of the movie watching experience.

For this, I used a scene from the Studio Ghibli film ""Princess Mononoke"" where tree spirits (kodama) start appearing in the forest.  The concept is that, in a mixed reality movie experience, creatures and elements of the environment within the movie could gradually appear/disappear in your space to give you a closer sense of ""being there"" without the complication of trying to craft an entire 3D VR scene.

This is my first stab at the concept with a Photoshop mockup, so my next step is to animate this to really give it the right feel.

Should it be interactive, though? If so, how much is enough? That's my question. I personally think it would be compelling to have a little kodama appear sitting on my knee and shaking his little hand. But something like being able to ""touch"" and sway the fireflies/glowing orbs might be just simple enough to provide that sense of awe without being distracting. What do you think?",
2456,sczhwenzenbappo,"As someone who has played around with both immersive movies and building 3D applications, adding any interactivity to a storytelling medium has to be carefully thought through. Just coz you can add 3D objects does not mean everyone will enjoy it. People come to movies for a disconnect from their world and hence anything that distracts them will not be appreciated. However, sports and documentaries may find these interactions add to the experience because remember how many times we pause and Google information mentioned during a program? Just my 2 cents.",

2464,xr_melissa,"Specific use cases and user preferences are definitely a good consideration here.

I agree that adding 3D objects just because you can isn't a good strategy. So my thought with this concept I showed in the image (which would be better communicated once animated) is a subtle and gradual appearance/disappearance of 3D objects that evoke a sense of being in the same environment as the movie scene depicts. So gradual, slow transitions rather than stark changes. Like when a movie slowly fades between scenes, but even slower. So perhaps the kodama could be something to edit out and the plants/fireflies/dimmed lights would be sufficient?

The amount of augmentation could also be something the user can adjust, similar to how the AVP has the reality crown to dial in the amount of MR/VR immersion.

Because I could imagine that although some people may want to Google some additional info while watching sports, others might find it distracting. So there likely isn't one ""proper"" way.

Phasing 3D objects in and out gradually would work better for movies, imo, because the pace is a lot slower. For something more fast-paced like a YouTube video, having environmental augments might be too fleeting.

But displaying relevant 3D objects is something else, like a product review showing different product options could be something, especially with a direct way to put it in your cart or something.",
2468,sczhwenzenbappo,"Absolutely! Subtle change works but do you think it works mid-movie? I can imagine going from a mixed reality to fully immersive in the beginning works like in a theater when the lights dim down during the commercials. Also, the genre of the movie would matter a lot.

(2) The intent here seems to be a way to soothe the experience of the outside world for people with sensory issues or perhaps a neurotypical person who wants some peace and quiet. Which is all well and good. But allowing reality to be *altered* rather than *augmented* is a slippery slope imo

Don't get me wrong; I'm all for cool sensory research in XR. But too many people are posting delusional things on social media about how this niche research is ""going to change everything"" when in reality, it's nowhere near a product roadmap that's actually going to reach the masses.",

Most AR devices have either more than one camera or a depth camera so they can get 3D information, as well as having IMUs (Intertial Measurement Units). If you are using just one camera, you need to know the properties of the camera so you can correct for lens distortion, and then you can potentially construct an understanding of the environment based on motion or by tracking a known marker. So just relying on one webcam and without asking your users to calibrate it (not sure if that is an option for you), your options and results will be limited.

That being said, you could look into Vuforia (I seem to remember they did single camera marker based AR), or write your own system with OpenCV. I am not aware of any other tools, but there may be more.",

2623,Competitive-Sun8913,Have been waiting for something similar where I can use the compute of my machine instead of the puck/on-device processing that seems to be the norm today..,
2624,dropsAR,"hey there, I have some first hand experience with having initially launched as a geolocation based audio app, ""pokemon go for music"" around 2017. Ultimately we pivoted to a full AR platform with audio as a feature alongside 3d content and have seen a much better response from customers. 

A few lessons that we learned with Augmented Audio : 

\- it's really hard to get people to install an app and then go to a specific location to discover music. The marketing funnel shrinks really fast, even if you're working with an artist that has a large following.

\- if it's curated content, it takes a lot of time and energy to create that content.

\- music, even pre-released music,  isn't enough of an incentive for people to go to a geofenced place. Especially when they can wait a few days for it to drop on a streaming service.

\- spatial audio guides and compasses are cool but people feel much more comfortable with a visual map.

\- at the end of the day, for us, audio became part of the experience, not the whole thing. Music offers cross-collaboration opportunities but there needed to be more for users to engage with.

I think there are plenty of creative opportunities ahead with Apple SpatialOS and Oculus. I know of an app called HearHere that is meant for roadtrips. I also remember Foursquare experimented with an idea called Marsbot. And in 2018 Bose had acquired a walking tour company called Detour for their failed BoseAR glasses.

hope that helps!",

I can imagine such geolocative apps is a difficult market, especially without visuals. A friend of mine has recently launched a geolocative social audio sharing app, I guess a bit similar to your original idea. He's been reporting similar challenges. :-/

I don't know how it was in 2017, but a bit later I think there became this slight hype of social audio apps (e.g. Clubhouse), and podcasts and audio books became popular... so I think (want to believe) people are getting a bit more accustomed to audio-only content. Though it's a slow trend.

I know HearHere, too, and it's almost a miracle if it's profitable business, but I really hope so. Probably audio is still considered somehow secondary to visuals, so people don't want to make an effort or *detour* to get just audio content, but either enjoy it while doing something else (like driving car from point A to B) or want to get some visuals with the audio (like in concerts, or in your app).",

Google Maps also makes it easier to understand your surroundings once you get somewhere — like if you’re exiting a subway station and need to orient yourself or if you’re scoping out a new neighborhood and need to find the nearest coffee shop. Lens in Maps (formerly called Search with Live View) uses AI and augmented reality to help you quickly acclimate yourself — whether you’re navigating a new city or discovering local hidden gems.  
Simply tap the Lens icon in the search bar and lift your phone to find information about nearby ATMs, transit stations, restaurants, coffee shops and stores. In our biggest expansion of this feature yet, starting this week Lens in Maps is coming to more than 50 new cities including A​​ustin, Las Vegas, Rome, São Paulo and Taipei.

and:

>**Know before you go with Immersive View for Routes**  
Google Maps provides over 20 billion kilometers of directions every day. And with AI, we’re reimagining how you plan your trips before you go. At I/O this year, we announced [Immersive View for routes](https://blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-updates-io-2023/), an entirely new way to preview every step of your journey — whether you’re driving, walking or cycling. This week, Immersive View for routes starts rolling out in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Dublin, Florence, Las Vegas, London, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Paris, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Tokyo and Venice on Android and iOS.  
\[...\]  
All of this builds on our work for [Immersive View for places](https://blog.google/products/maps/sustainable-immersive-maps-announcements/), which uses AI to fuse together billions of Street View and aerial images so you can know what a restaurant or landmark is like before you go. Now developers can also create their own immersive experiences with the launch of [Photorealistic 3D Tiles in Google Maps Platform](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/maps-platform/build-immersive-maps-at-scale-with-photorealistic-3d-2d-and-street-view-tiles-now-in-ga) this week.

User journey - scan QR code, The AR menu will appear which will have horizontal scroll of food items, user will select food item and 3d object will appear on screen table in AR, along with 3d object there will be price, and some description of food.

What we plan - 
There will be one platform where we will manage all the restaurants AR menu. 
we will have all 3d objects stored in DB and according to restaurant it will get display to user.

2881,incognoscente,"From your initial question, you want a device that is not currently quite available. You have to decide what is most important - form factor or function. And more specifically, if you prioritize form factor (as your initial question leads me to believe), then a more explicit understanding of what you'd like to do with the glasses because very important to guide you through the candidate devices. So, perhaps you can explain more what you want to do with them?

Meanwhile, let me lay down some options:

**Standalone ultra lightweight devices:**

**Vuzix Ultralite** (see my other response in this thread about those specifically) - simple small FoV monocular display - no sensors (camera, mic., etc.)  
**Ray-Ban Stories 2** \- no display, but! When they enable use of on device camera with voice interaction to Meta AI (multimodal input - expected Q2 2024), this is going to be an incredibly interesting device (literally visual search everywhere you go.). Also nifty live-streaming function. Few people will even know you're wearing ""AR"" glasses.

**Tethered ""sunglass style"" lightweight 3DoF devices:**

**XReal Air / Air 2 / Air 2 Pro** \- one of the better options if you just want a big virtual display. Support for SteamDeck, PC, Mac, etc via low cost Xreal Beam accessory or you can use a compatible mobile phone. The last 2 devices were just released in China so you might have to wait a bit to get them elsewhere - or you could go with the original Air.  
**Rokid Max** \- Rokid has been a strong competitor to Xreal (aka NReal) and their product is comparable but perhaps less software support.

**Functional middleweight 6DoF devices:**

**Lenovo ThinkReality A3** \- tethered to a mobile phone (which has to be Snapdragon Spaces compatible). Way more functional than any of the devices listed above with an outstanding display. Costs more, weighs more, gives you more. Support for Qualcomm **Snapdragon Spaces** (an emerging middleware standard) opens you up to a wide range of cool apps.

There will be a bunch more devices in this category coming out - probably at **CES 2024** in January. If you're not in a hurry, you might want to wait until then to decide if this is the class of device you're interested in.",
2882,AugmentedRobotics," Hi OP, here are a few AR glasses that could be recommended:

1. **Nreal Air:**  lightweight AR glasses designed for everyday use. It is also reasonably priced. 
2. **Rokid Air:** also lightweight AR glasses that are designed for everyday use. They have a resolution of 1920x1080 and are also relatively affordable.
3. **Magic Leap 1:** more expensive, but it offers better image quality and a wider field of view than the Nreal Air or Rokid Air. Its resolution and field of view are much much better BUT it is bulkier and has a shorter battery life.

For a broke student, 1 or 2 is more recommended! Hope this helps :))",

And will be released",
2884,Sankin2004,"Stay away from Inmo. A lot of what your looking for is what I’m looking for and Inmo air 2 promised to be all of these things. The problem is after finally getting some trusted reviews the device actually falls short on a lot of the proffered amenities. First when I tried to buy it, I’ve gone two almost three weeks without a word about my purchase other than the initial email sayin this is what you purchased, despite my attempted contacts. Speaker quality is garbage unless you don’t mind everyone around you hearing what you hear(no Bluetooth headphone support whatsoever). Super short battery life and your not able to use while charging. And most of the phone connectivity things they talk about are busted, laggy, or crashes often. Some of the in built apps work really great, but the external microphone quality is not good(for translating in real time-it can’t really hear the other person so well). It’s an android operating system with development features, so you might be able to build/connect some other apps if your a developer, but otherwise your stuck with a pretty poor selection of inbuilt apps. The $600 price tag looks good when compared with like the vision pro coming out at almost $4000. And the best feature of course is the no cables needed to run anything, with the ability to connect to wifi and use either gestures or the ring device to move and select items. But overall it promised to be the poor man’s vision pro and falls quite substantially below the mark. 

Otherwise pretty much everything else your going to run into something you have to compromise over, or just wait a while longer to see what new comes out. The two biggest issues you will run into are the price tag, or needing to be connected to something with cables(thereby destroying the covert glasses look). Your also going to run into issues with phone connectivity if you don’t have a newerish android phone(so far nothing has good support for iPhone without extra adapters and cables). On these devices you’ll also be limited to your phones battery life which will drain much faster than normal with little salvation unless you get even more adapters more cables and an external battery. 

**TLDR**    
There really isn’t anything out at the moment that hits all the points your looking for. And whatever you do stay away from Inmo air 2.",

The other main important piece is that the glasses have to be subtle and go under the radar in school, i wouldnt be allowed to wear sunglasses but can get away with glasses that look normal but are maybe a tiny bit bulkier as long as the lenses are not tinted. Other things like audio quality or cameras are added bonuses. I would also like the possibility of connecting my consoles to them however ik that they have to be wired in order do soto  would preferably be both wireless and wired.

Id mainly use them for class and to increase the amount of monitors i could have in class.

If you don't mind to clarify these two points:

>First of all, I tried again their AR glasses prototype and noticed that **the quality of the holograms looked improved.** They  seemed less noisy than my first experience with them. The noise was  still there, though, and was especially noticeable with objects close to  my eyes. Anyway, it was nice to see a quality improvement.

By noise, do you mean like laser projector speckle? [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle\_(interference)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle_(interference))

Or something lower frequency (less fine) which could be due to poor hologram recording uniformity?

&#x200B;

>**the 3D holograms were a bit transparent all looked like made of very noisy little colored dots**

AR translucency can usually be controlled by increasng brightness, if that is what you mean.

By little colored dots, do you mean the pixels/voxels had noticeable gap? This could be either due to their FLCoS display having large pixel gaps (small pixel fill factor) or the display not producing enough focal planes and the separation being due to pixels being on different focal planes. One way to be sure would be to check if it is still present on a flat object/image (such as GUI) displayed by it that your eyes are perpendicular to.

Also, did you notice the pixels pulsating/flickering this time around?",

I know the big companies do procedural mesh generation for AR, but I don't know if there are tools openly available. If there are then you might not need to train an AI to do the recognition.

If you can get a mesh of what is being looked at, you can then work out if a section of the mesh is (relatively) flat, matches the physical dimensions of a book and if the corresponding part of the mesh texture is the appropriate colour (i.e white pages).",

you can train a YOLO model to detect books, kinda. You might get 80% success rate with a ton of false positives. You can forget about reading the page number unless you get really close to the page.",
2950,AugmentedRobotics,"That's an interesting challenge and I hope you succeed in this endeavor! As many people have pointed out this is no easy task! How I would go about this is to:

* Develop an algorithm that translates a scanned text into a unique but simple identifier. Eg.: you could identify the 10 rarest words/names per page (probably it will have to be more clever than that)
* Now parse the pdf of the book page by page and get the descriptor for every page to build up your database.
* Now in your app: scan any page of the book by using an available OCR plugin for unity and extract the text on the page.
* Apply your algorithm on this scanned text as well to get the unique identifier and compare it to your database.
* If you are lucky you will know exactly which page you are looking at.
* There are many ways this can easily get more difficult. but I believe one might find solutions for all of them:
* Your scanning is not perfect: in that case, write a more robust comparison algorithm that will propose a list of the most likely pages. if there is no 100% match. Maybe the most important word is missing well if words 2 to 5 still match it still seems like a likely candidate. So calculate the confidence for each page. Maybe you ultimately need to get a better OCR
* Multiple pages could have the same identifier (not unique): So create a smarter algorithm. Maybe use the context of previously scanned pages as well this might help to narrow the selection of reasonable pages
* Your algorithm could be too slow: Well in that case find a way to get a less data-heavy identifier and optimize the matching

I wish you good luck with this project!",

2953,valdev,"I'll go ahead and outline some of the issues 

Even the best OCR is unreliable in the most ideal situations. Fonts are often different which throws text and number translation waaaay off. Think page 8008 vs page boob.

Page numbers are not always in the same location. 

Finding an open book could be harder than expected. Training an AI to find that it is an opened book will be harder and have reliability issues. Why? What defines a book, is it pages inside an open book? Hand outs? An ebook? Loose leaf printouts in a binder?

Then figuring out which book, holy moly, it would need to have context of the content of each page. Then what if they are going from one book to the other?

It's not impossible, but the cost difference between like a QR code vs all of this might be... Millions.",
2954,wilmaster1,"As a PoC I would definitely go with a single book, which you made yourself,where you use qr codes or trackable images to show content. This all so you know exactly what content to place, and to use the image location to place content. In a fixed location.

After you figure out whether the concept works you could consider looking into specifics to generalize the tech. Book detection using a barcode scanner is simple enough. But page detection of any book requires a massive library of book data, system to detect book location/orientation, and reading of page numbers or currently visible content. All of this doesn't even consider usability of such system to see if it's even fun/handy to use.

I would say, make a very fixed proof of concept, and see if you can get it running, then look at a bigger concept.",
2955,Stanssky,"I was thinking that my next experiment would be to test the plane detection function with the AR Foundation. It might not work as smoothly as I need (people complaining in AR  communities) but at least I'll start from somewhere. I suspect I would have to combine it with some other algorithms but hey, let's first make step one and see how it goes!",
2956,Stanssky,"Thanks for the feedback from both of you. I understand this is a challenging task. I wasn't going to be interested if it was a trivial one. I'm a senior dev but in a completely different area.

I've made a demo which recognizes the cover of a book and replaces it with its back - this was just for PoC for image recognition and replacement. The tracking of the image is good enough. However this approach doesn't make much sense for what I am aiming for. I already know that most of the ""Books with AR"" solutions track QR codes or images however I want to design a solution which would work with \*any generic book (no QRs) so QR is not an option.

Book recognition is the easier of the three tasks and have some options, as you said - barcode combined with some other methods. I also believe the page number recognition could be done using OCR and improved by adding some constraints once I find how to detect the borders of the pages/book.

&#x200B;

Do you have experience using OpenCV or a similar library? I understand it's used for object detection, so on theory if I have thousands? photos of opened books I could train the ML to recognize an opened book Then I should figure a way to measure the angle at which the book is being placed against the camera and define the borders of the pages somehow? Is this the only possible and viable approach?

And of course, experience with how to design things for AR/VR. But, its a thing that any developer can do. So try to be a developer. 

That said, you cant be a good developer without practicing. There is no beginning to the path, there is only practice. There is no ""best way to get started"".

3104,AfrikaXR,"Hello fellow Earthican. 
I hope I can help answer some of your questions regarding WorldCAST. I’ve been using their platform for about a year now for my own small AR startup here in South Africa, and I can confidently say that their platform is the most stable across both iOS and Android devices even over choppy mobile networks like we have here down in South Africa. Stability is crucial for me because many of the other platforms I tested claimed to offer X&Y and often times it just doesn’t work as advertised because they try and push the latest and greatest new features which can not be run on the majority of mobile devices because not everyone has the newest phones. I can’t sell an AR project to a client that might not work, then I look like a fool and charlatan. WorldCAST focuses on only a few features and it does them really really well, enough so that I feel confident in making a project for clients knowing that it’ll work on the majority of mobile devices therefore having a much wider audience reach. 
The 3D content/ sound etc sits on their own servers which are bare-metal IBM servers, meaning it is not a shared server, it is dedicated to them only, this helps with security and speed and helps lower the cost for small businesses. 
The reason why they are priced better than all the other platforms is because they have a INCLUSIVE vision of where they want AR to go in the future, they want to make it affordable to creators, many of whom are not particularly rolling in cash and have limited budgets. They are offering us small solo-creators the tools and chance at starting our own AR businesses that is usually only marketed to the monied upper crust of society thus making it exclusive to only those who can afford it. I’m my case our exchange rate is ZAR20-$1 and there was no way in hell I could afford a $250/month subscription with limited views which is what most other platforms price themselves at. 
The folks at WorldCAST are not greedy, they would rather see creators succeed against all odds because WebAR is the future and want to get as many people accustomed to it as they can without breaking bank. 
Look, I’ve worked on some big budget films in a previous life as an Art-Director and Concept Artist and I’ve been doing CGI for 20 odd years now and I can tell you straight up that WorldCAST is going to be the way forward, heck, I started using Blender at version 2.32 back in 2005 already and get a similar vibe between the 2 platforms overall contribution to the artists and creatives of the future. They are doing it for the creatives, not the capitalist, and their product just works rock solid. 

DM me if you want more info and don’t be shy to shout if you need help 🤘

I just really dig WorldCAST and am super passionate about promoting them because they gave me a chance to improve my situation in life where the other platform owners just skoffed at me because I live in Africa and wouldn’t even make the effort of listening to me.",
3105,baby_bloom,"[MyWebAR](https://mywebar.com/)might be what you’re looking for at a friendly monthly price especially compared side by side with Worldcast. however if you’re okay with getting a little deeper into the dev/design side of things, i’ve been using a unity asset called [Imagine WebAR](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/camera/imagine-webar-image-tracker-240128) and it is really kickass. for $200 one time you can publish as many webAR experiences as well as many views as your domain host supports! this is by far the best bang for buck and the quality is pretty up to par .",

3128,johnryan433,"Inmo just launched the Inmo Go exclusively in China, not to be mistaken with the Inmo Air 2, which is a lot bulkier. You can use a shipping proxy to get them or probably buy them on AliExpress for a markup. They are $250 USD or 1799 Chinese Yuan usually. They utilize green monochromatic waveguide lenses with 2000 nits of brightness, but they only have one waveguide lens’s which in my opinion is a huge drawback. It would be really cool if you bought two and melded them together. To make dual light weight glasses. I'd even pay you to make me a set if you figured it out; the battery life is 7 hours, so I’m assuming it would cut battery life in half, adding another waveguide lens. I am interested in doing this myself, but it would be a significant engineering challenge and sadly I’m not skilled enough. Modding the software should be fairly easy for me though. I think I can help with that and if I can’t I’d hire some who could.

Any idea how valuable the new iPhone software would be for this? Thx!",
3210,Spatial3DMarketer,"Well. ARkit and RealityKit, Development kits are filled with new tools and iOS is the leading AR ecosystem; it those tools you’ll find many ways to create the experience that let’s you place plants in a room. But as far as scanning tools go, most small plants are too complex to scan and use as is straight from a 3D scan app. You’re better off finding packs of optimized modeled plants, or optimizing your own high-fidelity 3D scans.🪴",
3211,jkarnsy,"Thank you! There is a setup we would like to test -- having an iPhone/iPad on a tripod, pointing it at a plant on a lazy susan (preferably automatic but manual if needed) with a static background behind it. Off the top of your head, do you have a suggestion for: iOS software to use, lazy susan to buy, and background to setup? Thanks!",

3217,_echo3D,"Wow! That is a lot more polished and cleaner than most 3D scanning apps. Most 3D scanning apps have a problem with meshing and most of the 3D models come out smooth or blended but Apple's version comes out with more detail out-of-the-box.

But that's very true about people who are going to use Apple's Object Capture to create an app that they'll charge people to use when it's free. Definitely avoid those apps or just create your own.

We're thinking about creating a free app with Apple's Object Capture so that anyone can upload their 3D models directly to our cloud-based 3D DAM. That way you can easily use them with an app or game with our SDKs. I believe right now, the 3D models are saved on your storage device and then you have to export it to a computer and then import it to your app or game engine. That's too many steps involved that can be easily reduced.

I know a lot of smaller e-Commerce sites are definitely going to take advantage of an Object Capture app to showcase their products in 3D and AR.",

3267,c_Gah,"I just got my kickstarter pair. I'm surprised there is such little talk about it, like nothing. I've had the INMO Air 1 and NREAL (now XREAL) Air and honestly the INMO Air 2's are the best experience on the market (for what they can do)

The INMO Air 2 is a full color, binocular, waveguide lens, standalone system glasses. In this market they are the first and only one of its kind and they actually work. Even better is that INMO released thier SDK so as a developer I can create whatever app I want for the glasses and use it. It's pretty impressive.

Positives to note when comparing them to the XREAL is that a bird bath optics system sits where your eyebrows are so a lot of your upper frontal vision is block, waveguide doesn't have that issue, also not being tethered to your phone increases usability 10x in my opinion.

The biggest caveat is that the screen size is small at 26 FOV, and I don't think this limit will be exceeded in the short term, the cost, battery power and heat just increase too much for tech and market at this time. This kinda makes it fall out of the ""monitor replacement"" category, which is what 95% of smart glass owners want to use them for. However, I can load up the youtube app and put on subtitles and have no issues. It's a perfect accessory for watching a movie on a plane flight.

That being said if you want a monitor replacement, or bigger screen size and don't mind being tethered to a phone the I would consider looking at the XREAL Air or Rokid Max.

I've also saved the biggest positive for last. The INMO Air 2 is the first screen glasses that my wife said she could see me wearing while outside and not immediately know something was up with them, they looked pretty normal.",
3268,supplex69,Where did you order yours? I visit the site everyday but the product is not available.,
3269,Automatic-FJG81,"I do. Here’s my take on them. The product had generated considerable hype, which piqued my interest. However, after a few weeks of usage, my experience has been somewhat mixed.

Design and Comfort

The fit of the glasses may not be an issue for everyone, but they don't sit well on my face. They perch too high on my nose, obscuring the bottom portion of the screen when viewing. Unfortunately, the glasses are not adjustable.

Performance and Features

The Inmo Air 2 glasses boast numerous innovative features. However, in my experience, these features have been inconsistent. The wireless capability of the glasses is impressive, but I've encountered the following issues:

The glasses cannot connect to Bluetooth headphones.

The phone mirroring feature is unreliable, functioning less than half the time.

The range of available applications is limited, and the quality of those that are available is subpar.

Other Observations

The screen size is smaller compared to the xReal Air 2 glasses. This could be tolerable if the screen resolution was superior.

Final Thoughts

In conclusion, the Inmo Air 2 glasses feel like a product still in the development stage. They have potential, but the execution is lacking. The unstable connection and short battery life make them a less than ideal choice for everyday use.

I hope that future iterations of the product will address these issues. Until then, I would argue that the Inmo Air 2 glasses are underdeveloped and require further refinement before they can truly deliver on their promises. It's also worth noting that customer service has been unresponsive.",

3276,15H391FT,"One question how is the battery life for regular use particularly video watching and hows the experience on ios (if you have tried them there)?

I have been stalking these on youtube and i have the same impression that even though they are rough around the edges there seems to be barely much talk around them.

They have the biggest advantage i wish x/nreal do not have and that is being wireless. I wish nreal would drop some of the fluff and go all in on making their glasses wireless. The inmos also can have a none shades version and still look “normal”.

I also feel the inmos could be smaller and lighter if they drop the cameras or at least make a version without the cameras on the front and bump up battery abit.

Im considering them as an accessory for watching videos on my work commute but was worried about the  whole thing being a scam or something.",
3277,Sankin2004,"Thank you for that. I recently put in an order through the Inmo website. I loose out on the super early bird discount, but I still got the early bird one with the free ring. The facts that it is cordless and stand-alone are both what are driving me. I mean a wearable screen maybe sounds cool, but if I have to be wired in it kind of defeats the purpose, ie I could just look at the screen of my device. 

Ideally I definitely see me using these out in public, mostly at work. Listening to my YouTube music while at labor, and maybe asking chat gpt for help when I’m stuck on a coding problem. The live translation has also peaked my interest for travel. 

Some cons I am aware of, the smallish screen size, the over loud speaker(though that can be fixed I think pairing a wireless earnuds), and a fairly short battery life with heavy use. Also I was made aware that the availability of apps was limited, lack of a web browser, and lack of google play availability. As a personal con I’m also gonna end up spending more monthly on my phone for upgraded data settings. (Hot spot data costs me more). 

That said, you’ve given me some small hope because as a beginning developer myself, I might be able to still install, or make the apps that I need. Have you developed anything for it yet? Another important question is can they be used while charging? I have a very large power storage so if they can I don’t have to worry about battery life.

All you need to do is generate the menu in html and maybe css. I'm sure ChatGPT can find you some starting code. Then you need a way to host the menu that the QR code will take people to.

Do you already have a website for your restaurant? Then you can host the menu page there and generate a QR code easily that will just take people to that page. Here's how to generate a code. 

https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9979877?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop

For the menu, there are many resources but I learned from the meta front end developer course on Coursera, link below. I think you should be able to get a free seven day trial and simple menu creation is one of the first projects.

https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer

But if you actually want AR, that's a bit more complex. You'll need something like Unity which is free but tastes some time investment and then you would still have to get the menu to load into a website. I'm also doing this now (because I want people to scan a QR code in my yard and enter a Halloween portal) and haven't found a good solution yet, I would have to use yet another product called zappar and they still charge for hosting your build.

Pretty much only well funded companies who don't care about Linux/libre can build hardware to take advantage of their software, otherwise it's just people playing with Valve Index in OpenXR.  It's such a wasted potential with no associated HDK project.

&#x200B;

There's no single HDK+SDK one can use  to develop PCVR hardware with.

Need positional tracking for your hardware? Grab a ~~Valve HDK~~ ~~Tundra Labs HDK~~ oh wait it's been out of stock forever. Make your own by getting a chipset and building your own HDK for 10K+ USD. What's that, can't afford it? Though luck.

Want SLAM tracking? Spend another 10K+ to make a custom 4 camera board with a 4channel MIPI input to USB3 output chip on it and one which can control the exposure time of each camera. Oh did you want a ready HDK for that? Though luck. Then go ahead and take a rough open source library like Orb-SLAM and spend hundreds of hours coding a real library around it for VR. Don't have the experience or time? Eat shit.

Want a HDK for controllers with LED or Lighthouse tracking? Eat shit.

Hardware devs are forced to go with Qualcomm chipsets and reference designs even when they are 100% interested in the PC platform. How much incentive do they have to not just stick with Android if they have to go that far?

Then we wonder why there's not many firms ""interested"" in PCVR, when the wall they have to climb is now 90 degrees steep.

Again, the tools Collabora is developing is very cool, but without any HDK around you're just going to have tinkerers tinkering with their old Valve Indexes.",

Modifying them requires a programming background, but actually installing xCode is pretty close to one-click, and then you just select ""run"" to run, and ""save"" to save, from the menu.

Installing the saved samples after you compile them on *your own iPhone* (or Vision Pro) is also close to one click, but you may need the $99 developer's license for that. Certainly, you need the Developer's license to install an app on more than one (up to 100? 1000?) device.

I'm wondering how smooth the textures will be and if their processing engine will smooth these 3D models out in the backend.

The only thing about creating all these 3D models on your iPhone is that they will take up a lot of storage space. The best solution for this is to store them in the cloud to reduce storage space. Since it's a native iOS app most likely we're going to be looking at USDZ file formats.

If you plan on using your 3D models for apps, games, or creating XR experiences, **echo3D**'s 3D digital asset management platform will allow you to store, edit, update, and stream all your 3D models in real-time. There's SDKs and integrations built-in with Unity, Unreal Engine, iOS, ARKit, etc. so that creating 3D content is a lot easier. You can even compress and convert your 3D models automatically for whatever application you need it for.

If you would like to learn more about echo3D's cloud 3D digital asset management platform visit www.echo3D.com.",

IMHO that's animation more than AR. It can be showcased as an AR layer, thus on top of a webcam, but still it would have to be designed in the first place. There might be existing but then arguably it wouldn't be hers anymore.

Anyway, where to start? Honestly anyway, can be Vuforia, Overlay, 8thWall, etc as long as you try somewhere you will, both of you, be confronted to the limits and then be able to eventually change.

Fill out the basic registration, pick the free plan (it's limited but usable & free), and download the app to your mobile device.

If you have ""creative block"" search ""AR art"" on the open web or on Etsy. Open the Artivive app on your device and scan the images one at a time  and kind of up close. You'll find examples of what a few others are doing. 

If you want to go with 3D effects you'll need (probably) Blender to create the 3D models,  Unity to animate the scene and Niantic Lightship to provide the technology to make it AR.

Its more intuitive and easier than the existing solutions over a long period of time. And its hardly noticeable, the person looks like they are just sitting rather than waving their hands around in front of their face.

The reason they introduce the SDK is to give developers time to use it. To test, iron out the wrinkles, and mostly to ensure the hardware has useful software by the time it launches. That's very common practice and very sensible. Who would buy the headset if there were no apps for it?",

3638,alchemist1e9,"How’s the Maverick dev kit working out for you? 

It seems the viable dev options are Everysight Maverick, Vuzix, and ActiveLook. The developer glasses from Everysight and ActiveLook don’t have cameras, Vuzix has the Blade 2 which is a full independent Android device and which has a front camera vs the Z100 which doesn’t and is a BLE device like the Maverick and ActiveLooks. 

I feel BLE displays are a good idea and more likely to catch on as they can be very lightweight and paired to everyone’s existing smartphones for apps. I’ve ordered the ActiveLook Enterprise, which is cheapest by far, and actually very very developer friendly, even providing their low level BLE protocol and open API/SDKs without any licensing requirements, they are also the lightest by far, but the screen is only 304 x 256 16 shades grayscale. 

https://github.com/ActiveLook/Activelook-API-Documentation

The lack of front cameras sent me down the path of looking for small BLE cameras, which apparently don’t exist, however that has had me discover what I believe is the current most viable ultra small developer friendly mini camera approach that could potentially clip onto standard glasses frames, run off battery, and wirelessly send images (maybe 2-3 frames/sec) over BLE to a phone. That appears to be a XAIO Esp32 s3 camera. 

As a developer I feel a modular approach of lightweight HUD glasses, front camera, and audio, perhaps all being BLE is a more practical way forward.   A mix and match approach would allow varied solutions for different preferences and situations. 

I’d be very interested to hear your opinion of the Mavericks for development and they do seem to be the most interesting device out there for lightweight high quality HUD style display, and if somehow camera and audio can be done as add ons. Everysight is coming from US Defense industry and built the HUD systems in US fighter jets and other military equipment. A good horse to bet on.",

Everysight Maverick looks tro be a slightly bulky sunglass that also has optional clear lenses for indoor or nighttime use.  Again, have not seen much on it other than what's on the website. But if the OS comes out like the demo videos on the website, then it's going to have the most robust HUD view in the most social acceptance form factor so far.

Edit:  Everysight also knows what they are doing. They had a cyclist HUD eyeglass called the raptor about four or five years ago.  They are taking the next step into general purpose use",

It is the initial release so we have to consider that plus they technically don't have final product package.

Oddly Apple doesn’t have the My Glasses one but Android seems to.

Even without speakers the mic is useful if that works. 

I was thinking if an app could use a combination of independent and relatively cheap components to cover HUD glasses, microphone, audio out, and forward POV camera and integrate that into something it might be popular. 

I wish there was a camera solution a bit like this but Bluetooth Low Energy and smaller. Or perhaps clips to glasses, however the back head mount might be more robust.

Interestingly a laptop with latest bluetooth 5.2 will pair with the code and then the glasses disconnect from it, but it clearly establishes a Bluetooth connection to some degree as the OS learns they are “Smart Glasses” which the device told it. But the glasses themselves appear to initiate disconnect from the modern laptop.

I'd hoped we had at least a base build of the OS and the apps we build tie into that to launch, however it's blank hardware at the moment.

It does look pretty slick and if stats are true it should have other sensors the Raptor didn't for their OS to work as shown.

Their software is pretty rough on the edges and clear more demo based. The head tracking where you look up or down get different panels/dashboards and turn side to side to move the cursor/selection is pretty intuitive.

The My Glasses has the hook to ChatGPT which I setup and is neat but … well needs improvement to be more than a trick, it can’t keep a conversation going or anything. I also tested the live translation app, and it works but does have trouble keeping up, they might be trying to do on device live translation which is a bit hard to do quickly give phone processor capabilities. I find foreign language videos on Youtube and play them with it listening and it does actually seem to approximately work for the languages I can partially understand. 

Definitely my favorite device I’ve acquired so far. Will be interesting to compare to Vuzix Z100s that are available now also and similar BLE based with similar specs.

3680,Shubhra22,"Hello, there are lots of free resources out there about how to make AR apps. With current development of Easy to use tools it’s getting popular to develop AR filters for social media. You can get started with Snapchat, tiktok or Facebook filters with their tools Lens studio, Effect House or Spark AR. 

However, if you want to create standalone apps, meaning you want to publish the apps on android , iOS or Web, I recommend getting your hands dirty with Unity. Unity has supports for hundreds of sdks, but most popular is ARFoundation, which is free and easy to use. 

I am gonna drop my YouTube channel and A free Udemy course in case you are interested. I talk about beginners AR development in my YouTube channel and soon going to drop a brand new course on AR app development from A-Z . Check it out

Thanks for kick starting your journey on AR segment , you have started A-frame which is best for WebAR and it will boost your confidence as well.

you can start developing core AR skills as below.

you need to understand the basics of AR technology. What is AR? How does it work? What are the different types of AR? Once you understand the basics, you can start learning the more specific skills you need to develop AR apps. can check below free course

[https://www.coursera.org/lecture/ar/google-ar-QD56M](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/ar/google-ar-QD56M)

Next AR development is a programming-intensive field. You will need to know how to code in order to develop AR apps. The most popular programming language for AR development is Unity.

Next steps you need to learn an AR development platform. An AR development platform is a software development kit (SDK) that provides the tools and APIs you need to develop AR apps. The most popular AR development platforms are Unity, Vuforia, ARKit, and ARCore.check below youtube course

3695,VirtualRealitySTL,"Oof, I totally missed anchored to the front of the building in the OP. Its easy enough that if you know where someone is standing + the direction they are facing, the OP could load the model the right orientation, but yea, anchoring full transform to building doesn't work just yet IIRC.

I do think they will add some sort of anchoring in the near future, especially if they make more wearable AR hardware.

My mistake OP, but still check out model viewer. Can't beat the price and it's fun to work with.",
3696,quaderrordemonstand,"The only thing that Meta has ever made is Facebook, everything else is a purchase. There's zero indication they have any idea how to make and sell hardware, or anything except intrusive low-brow social media.

Apple on the other hand, have made a lot of very successful hardware and software. This shows in what they actually produced. They always focus on the consumer interaction first. They carefully worked up to their launch, one piece at a time; the app store, lidar scanners, AR tracking, custom chips.

Meta by comparison is just throwing a lot of money at it and hoping it will produce something they can push at the consumer.",
3697,Appropriate-Bid27,"Exciting news, wondering what final price point they'd be targeting.",
3698,wpniewgoyu,"Lol maybe this a troll, but this just isn’t fair for a couple of reasons. Meta (Facebook at the time) bought Oculus nearly a decade ago. SIX years later in 2020 they produced a hardware device that has been the most successful VR headset with consumers by far, and even on pace with gaming consoles, — the Oculus/Meta Quest 2. They aren’t hoping to do that, they’ve already done it and will likely repeat this with Meta Quest 3 soon. They also have the Meta Quest Pro which is the state-of-the-art standalone headset (as far as what has been released). Also, keep in mind that when a company acquires another —- it’s not like the acquired company’s workers are all let go lol. For the most part at least, a lot of those same engineers continue working on their same product - just as employees of the new parent company instead. So regardless it’s not really logical to say we don’t know if Meta can make good hardware because they bought Oculus, when former Oculus employees just became Meta employees. Anyways I’m mega excited for Vision Pro and likely will prefer it to Meta devices. But it’s crazy to me how many people discredit Meta and pretend as if they’re incompetent, just because they don’t like the company or Zuckerberg. Meta is the current market leader in XR devices and will remain that at least until Apple has a smaller and cheaper form factor. I appreciate that Meta has “thrown a lot of money” at this, actually took the risk to build things, figured out a bunch of technical challenges (and often open source those solutions), and proved adoption could be widespread —- making all of this relevant enough for other companies to finally consider getting involved in the market.",
3699,quaderrordemonstand,"Oculus was a purchase. It was conceived by a bunch of people with a vision of what they wanted to create and largely driven by the talent of people like John Carmack who, like Apple, has a long record of achievement.

This thing isn't Occulus and its not driven by the same goals. It's Zuck's best attempt to prop up the share price by jumping on a bandwagon. That's all the vision it has and it shows.

Meta is the current leader in *VR* devices because it bought Occulus. Thats as far as that goes.",
3700,Sufficient_Growth_33,"From a development perspective, they have multiple mixed reality projects, all siloed and with completely different codebases. This is because they don’t have a cohesive vision, and the fact that they design within those silos says they will continue to produce fragmented products without a cohesive direction.",
3701,6loud9,"This is an absolutely terrible take.

> It's Zuck's best attempt to prop up the share price by jumping on a bandwagon. That's all the vision it has and it shows.

Zuck has repeatedly shown he has vision for the VR space, and sees it as the future for his company. So much so, that he has been pouring billions of dollars every quarter into its development. 

This course of action actually goes against the mainstream opinion, and has been the largest contributor to META's drop in share price. 

>Meta is the current leader in *VR* devices because it bought Occulus. Thats as far as that goes.

Again, META has been putting $5 billion+ each quarter into VR development. The tech they bought from Oculus 6 years ago is ancient technology compared to what they are shipping in consumer headsets today. META has played a huge role in pushing the VR industry forward, as well as creating a consumer market that make it worthwhile for devs to make game and apps in the space",
3702,wpniewgoyu,"Ok, I’m just lost I guess as to why you make this dichotomy between Oculus and Meta. Maybe some goals changed sure? But it seems like it was for the better anyway —- again considering Oculus went from a dev kit to a successor that became the most popular headset in the world under Zuck’s vision, whatever it may be. I think maybe you’re trying to say that Meta has just been riding the coat tails of buying Oculus and that is the sole reason they have found success in VR, which will not carry over to an AR device. This all makes 0 sense, again reiterating that Meta “purchased” Oculus way back in 2014. Also, curious how you feel about Meta Quest Pro? What mixed reality consumer headset, available today, is better in your opinion?",
3703,quaderrordemonstand,Do tell. What is Zuck's vision for VR? Is it Facebook in an Occulus headset by any chance?,
3704,quaderrordemonstand,"Its really simple. Occulus is not the creation Zuck. He's pushed money at it and that helped it reach market saturation, given what it is. Its the most popular VR headset which means its a niche product and nothing about Zuck's involvement has changed that. Zuck has no vision for it, or if he does, it hasn't made any noticable difference to what it would have been.

The Meta Quest Pro is a bit of a mixed bag. Its not especially nice to look at or comfortable to wear. But it is what you get if you put a camera on the front of an Occulus headset. It doesn't have the cohesive experience of the Apple device, but its OK. It's not good enough to be used all day as a work device and most people who buy VR headsets want to play games. But that's not how its really being pitched, so I'm not sure what the audience is supposed to be.

The AR device is a product of Zuck himself and so there's no vision beyond taking a slice of an imaginary future where people want Facebook attached to their face.",

The only two pain points I found are 3D modelling and its optimization for AR, and WebAR implementation with cross platform functionality. A lot of things in web that work on android don't work on iOS easily, and you might have to resort to a paid platform like 8thWall if you want something too specific like multiplayer or geolocation. But if you are planning on an app, the limitations are not so different from developing a mobile video game. The easiest way is using Unity with ARFoundation to develop AR for Android and iOS, and that's pretty much it.",
3735,Markosappsandgames,"I worked as an AR engineer and led a team for 2 years.

We developed multiple projects hor high profile companies / institutions and a platform for most of the relevant hardware like Quest, HoloLens, MagicLeap, Mobile, NReal...

Unity is the best tool atm since it is the first one to support new sdks, has most of the native features, supports all relevant hardver, is easy to use with lots of docs and tutorials, its versatile and cross platform, etc...
I actually wish there was a better tool since Unity is actually spaghetti code inside 🍝

WebXR is a cool idea, but it is very limited atm, not that good performance, not so great tooling, no native features, lacks sdks...

For me personally, the AR / XR seems to be in a constant prototype phase for now and near future. A lot of hype and looks cool, but not a lot of actually usefull real world use cases anyone would use more than once let alone pay for.

Some companies are willing to throw cash so that they can say they are doing something cool in AR, Metaverse etc. But from an engineering perspective this means rushed / barely working apps without solid engineering foundations because why would they when there will be like 20 users total.

I ended up switching to backend which I find more challenging and more engineering focused when working at scale.

Again, this last part is personal experience. Someone working at high profile XR companies may have different experience, or people might enjoy creating shorter experiences.",

Im surprised to hear Unity is the easiest way to develop AR app, as i have no experience with it other than some poor tinkering way too many years ago. May i ask, easiest in which way? Meaning, the most low-code solution?

The part about web based AR is a bit concerning, since the clients involved in the thesis seem to push or prefer a web based solution rather than a native one - but I already feared that it is still too limited and performance too low to be a viable option. Since i have accepted the thesis already, the reality you present is a bit crushing, since I had hoped things would have come a long a bit further within 6 years.

I took a photo of her art, masked and animated different layers and exported each layer with a green background so I could pull a chroma key and get my alphas, then I just layered them in 2.5D to get depth and parallax. 
I even added an Easter egg with a second QR code that is only visible once the initial QR was scanned, a bit like the movie ‘Inception’, dream within a dream, AR within AR 🤣

Mostly just an image target with separate video layers of my animations w/ alpha.  
Maybe one layer as a texture on a mesh at most. Not sure about that yet either.

3881,RealitiQXR,"If you want a research project for your learning then focus on WebAR segment with taking integration of AI, this will boost your technical as well as design abilities.

here are some hot topics and areas where a research project is needed in AR:

**Real-time object tracking and occlusion:** This is a key challenge in AR, as it allows AR objects to be placed accurately in the real world and to interact with real objects. There is still a lot of room for improvement in this area, especially in terms of tracking objects in complex environments and with occlusion.

**Haptic feedback:-** Haptic feedback is the sense of touch, and it is essential for creating immersive AR experiences. However, it is still a challenging problem to provide realistic haptic feedback in AR, especially for large objects or objects that are not physically present.

**Natural language interaction:-** Natural language interaction allows users to interact with AR systems using their voice. This is a promising area of research, as it has the potential to make AR more accessible to a wider range of users. However, there are still challenges to overcome, such as understanding natural language in real time and generating realistic AR content.

The field of view (FOV) is the amount of the world that you can see through the glasses.

AR can be used to display 3D models of objects and structures. This could be used to teach students about anatomy, architecture, or Civil  engineering. 

AR can be used to create quizzes and games that help students learn and practice concepts. This could be a fun and engaging way to learn.

Additionally, **Micro OLED** displays are also being developed for AR/VR glasses, and they offer even higher resolution and brightness than miniLED displays.

If you are considering using AR glasses as a monitor replacement, we would recommend waiting a few months to see what new technologies are released. The FOV and display technology in AR glasses are still evolving, and there is a good chance that new devices will be released with higher FOV and better displays in the near future.**Visor Headset**  will be released soon with   FOV of 100 degrees, this might be a good dill.

3931,Necessary_Court_4529,"eye strain is a personal thing that really happens on a case by case basis. i regularly spend 14+ hours a day looking at screens with no eye strain whatsoever. 

with that being said, consumer AR glasses project a screen at approximately the focal distance of a cinema. the distance of the screen to your face won’t be an issue in terms of eye strain UNLESS you don’t have good eyes, in which case you would be straining to see as if you weren’t wearing your glasses at the movies.

what many find so straining about AR and VR is reacting to and compensating for small movements, which gives them motion sickness. again, everybody’s brain is different, if you have “VR legs” already this won’t be an issue for you. if you don’t and purchase something like an xreal and you’re in mirroring mode, you’ll notice that the screen is static in the displays, but responds to small shakes of your head that slightly jostles the display in your vision. this shakiness is also what makes gyro-based 3dof feel slightly off, though the lower fov actually lessens these issues compared to early VR implementations like google glass. 

as with many things, the best idea is just to try it yourself. amazon offers free returns for 30 days with prime, and the xreal air and rokid max are both available from them. i bit the bullet on xreal airs recently and fwiw they are incredible.",

3948,RealitiQXR,"Sorry to hear your issues.

There are a few possible workarounds for this issue. One option is to use a different AR platform that supports ground plane detection on more devices. Some other popular AR platforms such  include ARCore and ARKit.

Another option is to use a different method of detecting planes in your AR application. There are a number of different algorithms that can be used for plane detection, and some of them are more robust than others. You may be able to find an algorithm that works on your Honor X8, even if it doesn't support ground plane detection.

Finally, you could also try to work around the issue by using a different type of AR experience. For example, you could create an AR application that doesn't require ground plane detection, such as an AR game that takes place in the air or in space.

Here are some  APIs that you might want to consider:

ARCore: This is a Google-developed AR platform that is supported on a wide range of Android and iOS devices.

ARKit: This is an Apple-developed AR platform that is supported on all recent iOS devices.

Unity MARS: This is an AR platform that is built on top of Unity. It supports a wide range of devices and features, including ground plane detection.

YMMV, personally I already struggle when using VS Code on a standard iPad, for anything smaller I can only tolerate Vim, and start feeling comfortable starting at roughly 14"", but strongly prefer 16"" and up, two or three screens.

Apple's Vision Pro will deliver the environment with good enough resolution and FOV, so I can see how I could use it on trans-oceanic flights (yet it's heavy), but despite having been on a lookout for years, now I don't see anybody getting ahead of Apple, frankly.

1- Audio Augmented Reality (AAR): This form of AR incorporates sound to superimpose digital information onto the physical world. For instance, an AAR application might play specific sounds when you approach certain locations, or it could offer audio instructions for a given task. 

2- Haptic Augmented Reality (HAR): This type of AR uses haptic feedback to overlay digital information onto the real world. For example, a HAR app might deliver gentle vibrations to your device when you approach particular locations, or it could provide haptic cues for specific tasks. 

3- Scent Augmented Reality (SAR): This type of AR utilizes scents to overlay digital information onto the real world. For instance, a SAR app might emit a particular fragrance when you approach certain locations, or it could provide scent-based cues to enhance your experience during a task.

4013,RealitiQXR,"Answers to your questions  as below.

&#x200B;

1-Is there an app I can use to turn pictures into AR?

there are a number of apps that can be used to turn pictures into AR. Some popular options include 

mywebar,  Aurasma ,  LARP etc.

&#x200B;

2- How can I turn products into AR?

There are a few different ways to turn products into AR. One way is to use a 3D scanner to create a 3D model of the product. Another way is to use a photogrammetry software to create a 3D model from a series of photos.

Once you have a 3D model of your product, you can then use an AR app to create an AR experience.

&#x200B;

 

3-How complicated will it be to do so?

&#x200B;

The complexity of turning products into AR will depend on the method you choose. Using a 3D scanner is the most straightforward method, but it can be expensive to purchase a 3D scanner. Using photogrammetry software is a more affordable option, but it can be more time-consuming to create a 3D model from a series of photos. 

&#x200B;

 

4-Will I have to make the 3D models myself?

You can make the 3D models yourself, or you can hire a company to create the models for you. If you choose to create the models yourself, you will need to have some experience with 3D modeling softwares like blender or unity or maya etc.

&#x200B;

 

5-How can I integrate these AR versions into my website (like Apple for example)

&#x200B;

There are a number of ways to integrate AR versions of your products into your website. One way is to use a web-based AR platform, such as **8th Wall** or **Vuforia**. These platforms allow you to create AR experiences that can be embedded in your website.

**How to Create Occlusion Masks and Materials for AR**

Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that allows users to interact with virtual objects in the real world. One of the key challenges in AR is occlusion, which is the ability to hide virtual objects behind real-world objects.

There are a few different ways to achieve occlusion effects in AR. One common approach is to use ARKit (for iOS) or ARCore (for Android) with custom shaders and materials.

**Using ARKit or ARCore**

ARKit and ARCore are frameworks that provide access to depth and scene information. This information can be used to create occlusion masks, which are black-and-white images that indicate which parts of a virtual object are hidden behind real-world objects.

**Creating Custom Shaders and Materials**

Custom shaders and materials are used to control how objects are rendered in the AR scene. By using custom shaders, you can specify how occlusion masks are applied to virtual objects.

**Generating Occlusion Masks**

There are a few different ways to generate occlusion masks. One common approach is to use depth maps. Depth maps are images that represent the distance of each pixel in the scene from the camera. By using depth maps, you can create occlusion masks that accurately reflect the relative depth of objects in the scene.

Another approach to generating occlusion masks is to use computer vision techniques. Computer vision algorithms can be used to identify and create occlusion masks based on real-world objects.

**Applying Occlusion Materials**

Once you have generated occlusion masks, you can apply them to virtual objects using custom shaders and materials. The occlusion materials should determine how objects interact with the real-world environment, ensuring proper occlusion of virtual objects behind real-world objects.

**Testing and Refinement**

Once you have implemented occlusion effects in your AR app, it is important to test them in different environments and lighting conditions. This will help you to ensure that the occlusion effects work as expected. You may also need to refine your shaders and materials as needed for optimal performance and visual quality.

I am not a programmer myself.

I have good experience with unity and ARFoundation.

Unity and ARFoundation are free to use (for Starters) and you will find a lot of tutorials on youtube about it.

It maybe depends on what kind of app you want to develop, but for me unity and ARFoundation was a good choice.

Cheers, Jonathan",
4037,SpyPigeonDrone,"Answering your question succinctly:  your best bet would be to learn Unity. It has been tailored to work with multiple platforms, it is tailored to work with AR/VR projects and you can find a lot of examples online. Plus its beginner friendly (to some extent). 

Answering your question more in depth:   
In my opinion the right answer to these kind of questions is another question: What do you want to build?  


From experience I can tell that the most successful apps/experiences were built by people who were excited to build them (this is key). If you're just learning a topic for the sake of learning and/or because you want to do it without a concrete goal in mind then the path will be very tedious and difficult (programming is not always fun).   


Your best bet is to try different AR experiences and choose one that you want to replicate. Once you've found one research how it is built (i.e did they use Unity?, is it deployed on mobile? VR? smart glasses?, etc). That will tell you the kind of things you will need to learn.

That said Apple has vision pro tutorials available to prepare developers for the upcoming release. 

Before you run looking for them I’d like to point out something. You dont know how to code…this means you will have to learn the basics first before jumping into the Vision Pro frameworks. Since these frameworks are Apple specific you will have to learn apple specific stuff early. 

There’s nothing inherently bad about that but it may lead you to overspecialize into a single platform which at this time may be a bad idea.

When mobile development was at the stage were VR/AR is right now mobile devs were normally able to deliver apps for both Android and iOS (granted they were much simpler then but I digress) as each ecosystem grew that kind of developer disappeared and today they are highly sought after.

You ca try the same sort of experiences with a Quest and passthrough mode for much less money and already available.

WorldCAST is great, I’ve built my own little AR business based on their platform and they haven’t let me down yet, always super helpful and their platform is rock solid from my extensive testing over the past year.",
4068,RealitiQXR," As per the WorldCAST AR documentation, you have the option to host the application on your own server. However, to achieve this, several specific requirements must be fulfilled:

Firstly, your server needs to be running a web server that supports PHP 7.2 or a later version. Additionally, the server should have the essential PHP extensions installed, including curl, json, and gd.

Another crucial prerequisite is possessing a valid WorldCAST AR license. Only with the proper licensing can you proceed to set up and configure the software on your server, as per the comprehensive guidelines laid out in the WorldCAST AR documentation. By adhering to these conditions, you can successfully deploy and utilize WorldCAST AR on your client's server, ensuring complete control and data privacy for their users.

&#x200B;

AR can be used to create interactive learning experiences that make it easier for students to understand complex concepts. For example, AR can be used to overlay 3D models of molecules on top of textbooks, or to create virtual field trips to historical sites. 

&#x200B;

AR can be used to help customers visualize products in their homes or businesses before they buy them. For example, AR can be used to overlay furniture on top of a living room floor, or to show how a piece of clothing would look on a person. 

&#x200B;

AR can be used to provide medical students with hands-on training, or to help doctors diagnose and treat patients. For example, AR can be used to overlay 3D models of organs on top of patients' bodies, or to provide real-time feedback on surgical procedures. 

&#x200B;

AR can be used to provide turn-by-turn directions, or to overlay maps and other information on top of the real world. For example, AR can be used to help people find their way around a new city, or to get directions to a specific location.

4097,vaxinius,"Here you go:

AR has the capacity to give analog back to what would otherwise be a digital only internet. Think about geolocation of a graphical overlay onto the exterior surface of physical places. Imagine if a URL like www mysite dot com was associated to a physical place.

The power doing this has, is by making physical location relevant to web browsers. Far flung away businesses could target business audiences in geographically specific places and give meaning to customers physically instead of just visually online. 

And it could be a wide spanning as to the extent we have web addresses like .com, .ca, .xyz and etc. You could switch channels and experience a totally different physical overlay, visually, on a physical space. This by itself has massive value to businesses looking for niche audiences but who are unable to afford physical storefront. It could kick off a brand new race for ownership of digital property having real world meaning to real people.

In comparison to ""the metaverse"" being some abstract fantasy world which means nothing to you and I in the real world having no physical/analog value.

Right now the concept is solely limited by the masses having access to AR powered optical wearables. Once these products hit mainstream, I'll happily jump in with both feet.",
4098,hoopyhooper,"I mean that's the Billion dollar question no one has really come up with a killer usecase for AR. Everything right now is just toys, or fancy marketing videos that don't really measure up with reality.

Ideally AR makes using a computing less isolating in physical space and more Human in nature. As far as I've seen AR visual devices face a backlash due to perceived rejection of humanity. There's also a ton of focus on visual devices when there's so many other things to augment, touch and sound aren't really discussed because they aren't flashy.

So, it can probably help with *anything.*  Just think of anything and ask the question, **""How can** ***sight*** **and** ***sound*** **help better this thing?""**

The struggle is the *path* from now to all that.  Everything that's ever been funded took someone saying ""This is worth something"" or ""*will* be worth something.""

6 - hands free communication much like wireless headphones allow us today but now with visual elements (FaceTime, seeing graphs or charts live, see who’s calling you without having to lift your phone or watch etc)

The first hurdle that comes to mind is a study where they measured the effects of mirrors on dancer’s technical skills. So they looked at dancers who often practiced in front of a mirror vs those that did not. 

Those that practiced in front of a mirror suffered technically once the mirror was removed and became worse dancers compared to their non-mirror practicing counterparts. 

The conclusion that was made was that those dancers became dependent on the visual cues they saw in the mirror. Rather than 100% of their focus being on the way their body’s feel in the moment, their attention was split between how they felt and how they looked. Once you removed the visual aspect, they couldn’t perform as well. 

I think this is highly important when it comes to AR/VR training. It would be easy to replicate some of the same mistakes as found in the study if the learned behavior or skill was too closely tired to the training process itself. 

To me this is easy to work around as long as you’re aware of it. You would just need a consistent unguided practice mode where the program still measures your technical ability while performing but you find out after, make adjustments with that feedback, and then try again.",

**About the study** (as you've described it):  
I'd be skeptical about any negative conclusions about the mirror-dependent dancers unless the study shows some way in which their dancing technique suffered to begin with.  Were these all WORSE dancers than the non-mirror dancers?  Because if they all had the same talent, then it would seem that both groups simply had different learning methods, neither better or worse(?)  Maybe if you forced the non-mirrored dancers to use mirrors, that would screw THEM up, too.

**To relate to AR:**  
So, perhaps an AR teaching system needs to be extremely customizable to the user/dancer, adapting to how they learn best.  As an ADHDer my mind organizes incredibly differently from others, requiring different tools.  Maybe some ADHD dancer would *constantly* benefit in practice by their AR darkening ""distraction areas"" of the room, and spot-lighting ""focus"" areas to dance in.",

4142,Vojcziech,Did you hear that quote and decided everything in your life works like that ?,
4143,chaosViz,Thanks!!  It looks really cool =),
4144,WhereTheLightIsNot,"[Here](https://iadms.org/media/5781/iadms-resource-paper-mirrors-in-the-dance-class.pdf) is a paper that references several different studies and resources on this. To summarize a little bit more succinctly: Physical movement training is heavily based on an internal proprioceptive experience. If you are taught to practice a physical skill in a way that relies too heavily on external stimulations, (such as your reflection in a mirror) when that external stimulation is removed, performance of that skill suffers. 

I think what I am referring to has less to do with learning methods (although that is absolutely crucial to this topic in other ways like you've mentioned) and has more to do with how the brain forms connections and neural pathways. 

I'm really bringing this up because I think it would be very easy to overdo the external stimulation in an AR setting.  If the student's brain associates the physical movement practice too closely with the visual or auditory cues in AR instead of the internal proprioceptive or kinesthetic feeling of the physical movement, when those are removed (anywhere outside of AR training) there may be a mismatch between the student's ability to perform technically during training vs outside of training. 

All that being said, this is more of a tangent from your original post than anything else haha. I'm fascinated by this use case in AR and believe in it strongly. There are so many areas of thought surrounding this that we haven't touched on. 

As a fellow ADHDer myself, I've somewhat recently shifted my focus toward working on organizational tools designed specifically for AR to help with how my brain works so it's funny you bring that up. Would love to hear your other ideas!",

e-book reader will need to be accessible through a web browser, so you will need to use a technology that can render augmented reality content in a web browser.  can choose webar playground from any agency or can create on your own via ar tool kit

4236,RealitiQXR,"Hello You can follow below to start developing your idea into reality.

Choose a development platform like Unity or Vuforia that suits your needs for AR app development. Gather data about your office building's layout, seat locations, and occupant names. Use floor plans or mapping services for this. 

Create 3D models of the office building and seats using software like Blender or Maya. 

Add tracking data to the 3D models to enable AR tracking, using markers or the device's camera through opensource sdk/libraries or can create packages also. Design a user-friendly interface with a start button and an office map for easy navigation. 

  test the app on various devices to ensure functionality and bug-free experience. 

&#x200B;

Considerations for using headsets part  Headsets offer a more immersive experience but can be more expensive than smartphones due to additional hardware and software requirements you can check out any VR agency who can provide you in less cost.

&#x200B;

Using a development platform like Unity or Vuforia streamlines the process, making it faster to create and release your AR app. 

Hope above helps if need any additional information can always reach back to us via our website [https://realitiqxr.com/](https://realitiqxr.com/)

Thank you and have a good day.",
4237,Toan17,"You could do this pretty fast and easily with Microsoft Azure’s cloud Spatial Anchors service and a native iOS/Android app using ARKit/ARCode.

You would just pre-set a bunch of spatial anchor waypoints denoting real-world locations. Then you would write some pathfinding logic in the app to direct the user from their current location through a series of the waypoints with AR markers to show them the next set of directions or whatever until it leads them to where you want (i.e. walk from entrance, to lobby elevators, then take elevator to correct floor, then walk from elevators to this area of the floor, now your seat is down this aisle on the right, etc).

As you said, this would easily be done as a native smartphone app, but you could use headsets as well (although this is likely overkill for your use case).",

Hey thanks for the reply, somehow only noticing it now.. your site looks awesome!   


This is just for a hackathon sort of a thing I don't need to use it on all devices I will try for just android to begin with.. A question I have is do you think visual markers would be enough for a good navigation experience or would i need to buy beacons?  


It doesn't need to be perfect but obviously I want it to look good.",
4240,anonymous_profile_86,"Thanks for the reply, is there much in getting up to speed with it or handy enough? Any coding behind it or is it drag and drop UI stuff.

Also was thinking about putting together like an office treasure hunt sort of a thing would this be good for that too?",
4241,anonymous_profile_86,Any idea on how close together I would need to put them?,
4242,Toan17,You would have code the connection between your app and the Azure Spatial Anchor’s API (pretty standard stuff). Then you would also need some form of UI for the user to receive directions. This could be as simple or complex as you want.,
4243,anonymous_profile_86,"So this Azure Spatial Anchor's API how does that work do I need physical devices to be running it or how do I set the way points, and links for learning materials on this stuff and any idea on the cost of using the API is there a free tier?",
4244,RealitiQXR,"Hope you are using  MagicLeap object tracker api and created an object. Then, you would need to call the Start() method on the object. This will start tracking the objects in the scene.

Once the object tracker is started, you can call the GetTrackedObjects()  
 method to get a list of all the objects that are currently being tracked. This list will include any barcodes that are in the scene.

Once you have the list of tracked objects, you can iterate through the list and find the barcode that you want to scan. Once you have found the barcode, you can get its position, orientation, and size.

4246,RiftyDriftyBoi,"I dunno, I don't necessarily see the mobile form factor as a 'Make or break' kinda deal if you design the app around it.

For phones the real benefit are 'Magic window' style games where the phone is used as some type scanner/eye/view into a another world.

Consider an AR game where you'd hunt ghosts, but the only way to see them is to scan the area with your phone.",

Imagine strolling through the city streets, surrounded by shades of gray. Now, picture taking out your phone and being granted the power to change that scenery!

Everywhere you go, you can toss 3D seed balls, and watch as plants magically sprout and come to life. Dull, cold concrete transforms into a vibrant tapestry of colorful flowers and lush greenery! The beauty lies in the randomness of the process, as vines spread and seed balls take root, ensuring that each experience is unique and mind-blowing! 🤯

It's pure magic, every single time! ✨
