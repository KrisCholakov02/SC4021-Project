1. Where to start in AR? What to read, watch, research, follow?  
2. What is the scope and project workflow/pipeline in general? Inside the app (how it interacts with the world), and outside (considering OS, glasses?). What is the process of developing?  
3. How to choose between Unreal/Unity? Are the the best choices? and How do they interact with ArKit and ArCore?   
4. What type of programming language do I need to learn? And are the visual assets created inside the softwares or should they be made in seperate softwares (like AE or Cinema4D), and what is the ratio between coding:visuals.  
5. How the product get tested before launching? Is there a software or some kind of support in OS to test beforehand?  
6. In your opinion, career-wise, what is the projection for the demand of such area? And starting from 0 how many months/years would it take to start making money out of it? What can I do extra to speed up the process?  


Please feel free to share any information/experience you have.   


P.s I have no experience in software/app developement at all - other than some programming courses back in university. My professional background is video editing/motion graphics/design for 6 years, but I feel like a career shift is due.

What is Photon-to-Photon Latency:
 
A Head-mounted display's Photon-to-Photon latency describes the time it takes for the image to be transferred through the headset, to the user‚Äôs vision. When measuring the latency, we calculate the time difference between the lit of the light and the sense of that light on the location of the perceiver.  

The test confirmed Apple Vision Pro‚Äôs extremely low latency of ~11ms. The competitors' results are in the range of 35-40ms.

It gradually got more familiar over time though. So I wrote a quick blog post about how to choose the right starting point for you, and how to learn it effectively. You can read it here:

I can also envision many additional applications of the technology, such as assistive applications for those with a disability, or fast charting/order entry for medical practitioners to name a few.

xrmasiso,1670868563.0,,zk6ji2,t3_zk6ji2,8,38," I asked ChatGPT to rewrite the entire code of an Augmented Reality App‚Ä¶

What I asked wasn‚Äôt difficult for an experienced developer since the functions were simple and only involved simple internal Unity and AR Foundation methods‚Ä¶ and yet, it was able to figure out a creative solution to distinguishing UI/Canvas elements from other game objects and reminded me of a nifty syntax for a concept called ‚Äúcasting‚Äù. 

I asked it rewrite 3 scripts from scratch, with no example code. In a matter of seconds it spit out 3 working scripts that I copy-pasted into Unity and then built onto my phone.

I think that we can all agree that while ChatGPT is a simpler version from its sibling and its up and coming successor, GPT4, its intuitive use is on its way to revolutionize the way we interact with obstacles in development, art, and honestly, generally, life.

valdev,1644501291.0,,sp75j2,t3_sp75j2,41,35,"Hey everyone, I know many of you are AR developers and if you are reading this I am not targeting you for this. We already know what is impressive, what is interesting and truly revolutionary.

Who I am hoping to target here are solution providers, entrepreneurs, and people who are looking to provide something novel to the AR landscape.

I've worked as an AR engineer and CTO for years where I have had the opportunity to meet with truly revolutionary software providers who provide a service that is unique in the AR landscape.

But, the overwhelming majority of the solutions I've seen are providing extremely basic... not useful... not novel... integrations. And I think the reason for this is because most of the companies in this space start by trying to create an application of their own, then realize no one wants to use it so they shift into providing their foundation as a software solution.

I could ramble on this forever, but let me be brief. ***Providing a web based solution where you can upload 3d assets and drop them on a map and have a companion app show these assets relative to your gps location isn't novel and is not really providing value.***

Geo-locating and mapping objects based upon GPS location is a 15 minute problem that anyone can do, and it is absolutely the least consistent experience. Downloading the geolocation points with the 3d asset is also extremely easy.

Here is a list of things that start to build a novel concept that brings value to the AR space

1. Ability to create high quality point maps, potentially with stitching and change resistance (maybe self healing with data points over time).
2. High quality object occlusion. Yeah its neat to put an object out in a field, but it looks dumb when any person or a tree can go ""behind it"" but the object stays on top.
3. Large point cloud geo-location. Want to provide an online service where you get to put your objects on a map and they stay there? This is the way to go.
4. Location and high precision movement correction. Putting an object around you is great, and if it sits within an inch of its intended placement on load is great, but as the user moves it needs to stay put.

GPS is the single worst, first layer approach to markerless AR. There are hundreds, if not thousands of companies at this point offering a cloud solution where you can upload objects and put them on a map for your users to see them. But it by itself is a TERRIBLE, unacceptable, AR experience. GPS is great for figuring out where the user is in order to localize a good experience. But GPS sucks in cities, it is unusable inside and the latency is awful (especially on iphones). And let's not get into the battery usage.

Sorry for the rant y'all, but this has been bothering me lately. Seeing so many companies all trying for the easiest most worthless solution is making me sad, AR is such a beautiful space with so much opportunity.","I've seen a lot of posts about ""Unique solutions in the AR space"", I think it's time we talk about what is impressive and what is... not.",0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/augmentedreality/comments/sp75j2/ive_seen_a_lot_of_posts_about_unique_solutions_in/

productceo,1610509158.0,moderator,kw849h,t3_kw849h,4,31,"# Nice to meet you!

I am productceo, joining the mod team for [r/augmentedreality](https://word-edit.officeapps.live.com/r/augmentedreality) this year. I want to thank dronpes for creating this valuable community, dedicated to AR, 12 years ago. For the past several years, dronpes has been occupied by events outside of this community and was unable to provide active moderation. Starting this year, I will be here to assist the mod team, to actively listen to your voices, and to make sure this community becomes what you need and want it to be!¬†

# Where are we today?

With over 25,000 members, r/augmentedreality is the world's largest online community dedicated to AR. When I asked you through a survey last year, I heard from you that 57.7% of you are AR software creators (researchers, developers, designers), 37.5% of you are AR enthusiasts (consumers), and the remaining 3.8% of you are AR hardware creators. This breakdown explains community preference of posts. Today, most submissions are news articles or concept designs. However, most of top posts by vote count are showcase of original work from which community members derive inspiration and knowledge. We will systematically promote such ""useful"" posts to better serve the AR software developers who are our most numerous and most engaged community members while making sure that AR enthusiasts and AR hardware developers do not feel left out.¬†

I also asked you what changes you want to see. These are some opportunities I heard from you or noticed myself:¬†

* **Organization of** **posts:** Successful communities use appropriate post flairs to organize content. Today, [r/augmentedreality](https://word-edit.officeapps.live.com/r/augmentedreality) lacks an effective filtering system that would empower the community members to skip over uninteresting posts and get to the interesting ones quickly.¬†
* **Opportunity to** **learn from each** **other:** Successful communities host AMAs and promote original content to provide unique value to the members. Today, [r/augmentedreality](https://word-edit.officeapps.live.com/r/augmentedreality) lacks such programs.¬†
* **New member guides**: Successful communities establish new member guides to help newcomers immediately reap value, save returning users time by reducing rookie questions, and set clear expectations for what kind of submissions would be welcomed by the community. Today, [r/augmentedreality](https://word-edit.officeapps.live.com/r/augmentedreality) lacks any new member guides or community guidelines.¬†

In summary, we need to first work on the fundamentals to become a robust community in face of expected growth as AR gains popularity, then introduce changes to systematically promote quality content that caters to AR developers and enthusiasts.¬†

# What are we doing this year?

We will do what we need to do! We will work on getting our fundamentals right, then work on increasing the value of this community in advancing your work.¬†

**Top Priority**

* **Post Flairs:** I will review top posts by vote count from the past, then populate an initial set of post flairs. Then, I will calibrate the post flairs by hearing from you whether we have missing flairs or unused flairs.
* **Promote Original Content:** I will create a system to help you get attention and feedback from the community for your original work.¬†
* **New Member Guide and Community Guidelines:**¬†We will create a guide for new members to help them get started on AR and become valuable contributors in our community.¬†

**Default Priority**

* **AMA with Industry Experts:**¬†I will invite experts from top universities and companies to host exclusive AMAs on our community. If you are interested in participating as an expert, please contact the mod team, and I will work with you to make it happen.¬†
* **Capture of Our Collective Knowledge:**¬†We will create an ‚ÄúAR Awesome List‚Äù that serves as a valuable living document for the entire AR community. We will design systems to make sure you get the acknowledgement for your contributions to the document.¬†

This community belongs to all of you. If you notice anything we can be doing to make our community a more valuable platform to you, please message me and the mod team anytime!¬†

# We will grow together!

Each of us are here, because we share the same vision for the future. We believe that AR will change the world. AR will change how any person does any thing for every person and for every thing. And we are proud to know that¬†[r/augmentedreality](https://word-edit.officeapps.live.com/r/augmentedreality) is at the forefront of this change.

We will defend our position as the world's largest online community dedicated to AR by increasing the value each member gets from being a part of this community, by helping each member get the information they need to build great AR products. We will defend our position by making sure that when great AR products gain popularity and change the world for better, the developers behind them are none other than you, the members of this community!",Announcing New Year Plans for r/AugmentedReality,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/augmentedreality/comments/kw849h/announcing_new_year_plans_for_raugmentedreality/

I‚Äôve been testing their platform and tech to see if their services could fit into my software stack as a small startup business. Besides for coding which scared the crap out of me at first, I eventually got the hang of it and kinda started to like it, until I asked about prices. 

They claim to be all about democratising AR for all, yeh right, if by that they mean Classical Athenian democracy that is only valid for the moneyed upper crust of society then sure... 

Well fuck them!! They just lost the African continent market share!! There is no way that ANY company on our ancient continent can afford those prices. You either have to be doing work with their platform for free as an NGO but it‚Äôll still cost you $99/month but you can not charge for your work as an artist or you have to be sucking off some corporate giant to be able to afford their license. No place for startups or entrepreneurs in their world view, and their marketing guy has the nerve to say he understands how this could limit my use of their platform, no shit dude! You must have a god damn IQ of 120!! Company policy he says‚Ä¶ corporate sellouts just like Autodesk. Presenting themselves as these bastions of good for the peoples of the world but secretly they just sit there counting their riches away from the populaces hungry gaze. 

Any platform developers who are keen to get their platform exposed to another potential 1 Billion people and counting dm please and let‚Äôs change the world for the better and get AR mass adopted and common place so we can move forward with innovation. 
I‚Äôm looking for multiple vendors to assist in this mammoth task as not any one platform can serve all my needs at this time.

A big shout out to the folks at WorldCast.io for already stepping up to the table and offering to help, it shows good character and company ethos. 
But if there are any other platform developers or visionaries who also wish to help me/ us make a change on a forgotten continent then please get in contact, this is not my 1st rodeo and is not just some pipe dream, things are already in motion and starting to roll. 

Sorry for the rant, but I feel betrayed, belittled and angered by this 8th Wall company. Sellouts to the cause and now part of the problem in my opinion.

Shubhra22,1532155907.0,,90nh1q,t3_90nh1q,6,31,"Hello Guys,   
I started this Complete AR fundamental course on April 25. Till now uploaded 11 tutorials on how to make Augmented Reality App with unity and vuforia. I am trying to keep my tutorial different from usual ones. Also trying to make it simple so that both people with or without coding skill can get in depth knowledge on Vuforia. I don't have much subscribers but feedback from the learners are amazing.   


After two - three weeks of gap I again started posting new contents. I hope you will like my videos and ofcourse send me requests for any particular topic that you want to learn.

Meta Spark allows you create some really interesting experiences this way without having to learn C# in too much detail.
