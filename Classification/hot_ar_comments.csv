HammerFET,"Yeah there's two ways of doing it really. Frame itself is designed to be low power so doesn't have an application processor similar to what you might find in a phone or SBC. It does however have an FPGA which is directly handling the camera input. FPGA devs could leverage this for custom vision DSP and combine it with the onboard microcontroller to do some very clever things. This would be vert fast and efficient, but the most complex in terms of development.  
  
The other way would be to stream image frames to a phone/PC and make use of the powerful hardware there for vision processing. This would be a lot slower but maybe a better way to get a proof of concept together before diving deeper. There will be more controls on the camera API soon so it should be fairly flexible and hackable.

HammerFET,"Great question :)

One of the biggest challenges was waiting on the super long leadtimes of different parts and assemblies. On firmware, a lot of code had to be written before we had any real hardware. On hardware we had to do the mechanical design before we pinned down the final electronics. And for a long time we couldn't really test the optics because we didn't have the graphics ready. It was a lot of chicken and egg. Often it meant that we had to think ahead of the curve and predict potential problems early. A lot of tasks happening in parallel, where you had to be comfortable to take risks and be ready to change something quickly if it turns out not to work later. All in all, we really had to work as a team and not try to just do things our own way

We did a lot of iterations, but it all came together in the end :)

Regarding your second question, Frame for me sort of takes me back to the early days of computing. It's not at all powerful hardware compared to the phones we carry around in our pocket, but it represents a blank slate where totally new possibilities might exist. Unlike so many devices today, Frame isn't designed to only consume, but also to create. To me at least, that represents the real essence of computing. I hope because of this, folks find new and ways to use Frame in their day to day lives, without being constrained to specific ways of thinking, or be biased by how a company says they should use the product. The user should be free to make anything they like, and quickly the line between consumer and developer might disappear again :)","<div class=""md""><p>Great question :)</p>

Any-Tone-5741,"Given your interest in augmented reality (AR) development and your preference for a laptop over a desktop due to logistical reasons, let's address your concerns.

Firstly, the belief that laptops aren't suitable for AR development isn't entirely accurate anymore. Modern laptops, especially those designed for gaming and creative work, come equipped with powerful processors, high-performance graphics cards, and sufficient RAM to handle AR development tasks. The ASUS TUF 15.6"" FX507ZI F15I74070 Gaming Laptop you're considering, with a 4070 GPU, is a testament to this advancement. Such specifications are indeed capable of supporting AR development environments and the necessary software.

However, there are a few considerations:

* **Performance vs. Mobility**: Laptops offer mobility but can't always match the raw power and upgradability of a desktop. If you prioritize portability and space-saving, a high-spec laptop like the one mentioned could serve you well for AR development.
* **Future-Proofing**: AR and VR technologies are rapidly evolving. While the laptop may meet current needs, desktops offer easier upgrades for future requirements.
* **Thermal Management**: High-performance tasks like game development and AR simulations can cause laptops to heat up more than desktops, potentially throttling performance.
* **Budget vs. Needs**: If the laptop fits within your budget and meets the minimum requirements for the development tools you plan to use (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine), it could be a worthwhile investment. However, ensure it has enough RAM (16GB is often recommended for development tasks) and check the compatibility with your AR headset.

In summary, if the laptop meets your current needs for AR development, offers the convenience you're looking for, and fits within your budget, it could be a good investment. However, consider the long-term aspects and whether a desktop might offer better value and performance in the long run, especially if you're planning to develop more demanding AR experiences.

Given the specifics of the ASUS TUF laptop you mentioned, it seems like a capable machine for starting your journey into AR development. Still, ensure to review its specifications against the software requirements for AR development to make an informed decision.","<div class=""md""><p>Given your interest in augmented reality (AR) development and your preference for a laptop over a desktop due to logistical reasons, let&#39;s address your concerns.</p>

<li><strong>Thermal Management</strong>: High-performance tasks like game development and AR simulations can cause laptops to heat up more than desktops, potentially throttling performance.</li>
<li><strong>Budget vs. Needs</strong>: If the laptop fits within your budget and meets the minimum requirements for the development tools you plan to use (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine), it could be a worthwhile investment. However, ensure it has enough RAM (16GB is often recommended for development tasks) and check the compatibility with your AR headset.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, if the laptop meets your current needs for AR development, offers the convenience you&#39;re looking for, and fits within your budget, it could be a good investment. However, consider the long-term aspects and whether a desktop might offer better value and performance in the long run, especially if you&#39;re planning to develop more demanding AR experiences.</p>

<p>Given the specifics of the ASUS TUF laptop you mentioned, it seems like a capable machine for starting your journey into AR development. Still, ensure to review its specifications against the software requirements for AR development to make an informed decision.</p>

This stuff is not new BTW, and there were companies making incredibly dense 360 videos 10 years ago, although stitched from multiple cameras.  
  
The problem is storage and processing.  
  
But, the last time I was paying close attention to this, there were already breakthroughs being made with directional streaming, where the video would download higher resolution pixels for where you were actually looking.  
  
If you could tie that into foveated rendering techniques, you could stream a very small amount of data, and it would get the size down while being mostly imperceptible to the user… sort of like mp3, h264 and mpeg, which do sacrifice quality, but are way more efficient to download and playback.

For immersive videos, they wrap around your field of view.  This effectively leaves you with a cropped image. 
So at any given moment you need to have roughly 4k of view in your current viewing crop to seem as sharp as a regular 4k film. 

As a result, 8k is basically the baseline for the quality. 

Now when you do stereo video, you need twice that. Canons current stereo capture system uses a single sensor split across both eyes. So you need 2x8k on one sensor. 

They could split into multiple sensors like most everyone will do for movie shoots, but that’s not the market they’re addressing. Their market is more plug and play consumer to professional shooters. Even their highest end video cameras are more geared to run and gun/ documentary shooting.

Shooting two cameras is pretty arduous. You end up with a lot more cost, a lot higher weight, difficulties syncing them and getting their eyes correct. Canon are rightfully sticking with a single sensor with a split lens for their user base. 

As to your question around capture vs display, canon could absolutely make a higher resolution sensor. There are already cameras with that resolution from cinema camera makers.

But 45 degrees is not a difficult FOV to setup in a test. I can look at his test pattern, and see his results are not similar to what I’m seeing. I’m not speculating. I am sure.  
  
In his results, it’s a blurry mess. With just my eye, I can’t make any calculations in terms of PPD, but I can clearly see specific things. In his results, “Ariel 6 point” is just a slightly stratified blurry smudge. But I know I can see the individual letters in HMD when that image is occupying 45 degrees.  
  
I can’t perform any math on my subjective observations, but I can clearly diagnose that his results are not representative of what you see.  
  
I know he’s an experienced guy, but he’s new to the AVP. It doesn’t really matter how many pictures you’ve taken of lady bugs, you still might find that your picture of a flea looked blurry. It would take a certain amount of hubris to conclude “fleas are blurry”, rather than to simply say “my camera wasn’t able to get a clear picture at this scale”, but here we are.  
  
If his setup was able to resolve individual pixels, and could measure their density, there’d be a lot of other types of observations that would be less suspect of measurement failure. “Blurry” is not one of them. “Blurry” is a common camera problem.  
  
So, his camera images look blurrier than the AVP actually looks, and he wrote a whole article about how blurry the AVP looks. It’s weird that this happened, and it will undoubtedly be embarrassing for the guy when he realizes what happened, but here we are.  
  
Maybe someday you can get your hands on an AVP, look at his test pattern, and decide for yourself.  
  
But I know what I saw. I’m going to trust my own eyes more than I’m going to believe you, or some random tech blogger.

<p>I can’t perform any math on my subjective observations, but I can clearly diagnose that his results are not representative of what you see.  </p>

<p>I know he’s an experienced guy, but he’s new to the AVP. It doesn’t really matter how many pictures you’ve taken of lady bugs, you still might find that your picture of a flea looked blurry. It would take a certain amount of hubris to conclude “fleas are blurry”, rather than to simply say “my camera wasn’t able to get a clear picture at this scale”, but here we are.  </p>

<p>If his setup was able to resolve individual pixels, and could measure their density, there’d be a lot of other types of observations that would be less suspect of measurement failure. “Blurry” is not one of them. “Blurry” is a common camera problem.  </p>

<p>So, his camera images look blurrier than the AVP actually looks, and he wrote a whole article about how blurry the AVP looks. It’s weird that this happened, and it will undoubtedly be embarrassing for the guy when he realizes what happened, but here we are.  </p>

<p>Maybe someday you can get your hands on an AVP, look at his test pattern, and decide for yourself.  </p>

<p>But I know what I saw. I’m going to trust my own eyes more than I’m going to believe you, or some random tech blogger.  </p>

<p>And you’re going on reputation alone, and you’re going to trust some random tech blogger over some random stranger on the internet.   </p>

You can make straw mans all day but I still never said anything about estimations. The problem IS that you're just estimating but then feel like you can compare your results to real measurements 1:1.

>45-degrees of FOV means a real thing. It’s an observed quality, the angle itself is as complex to calculate as folding a piece of paper along one corner. If you wanted to go nuts, you could use a protractor and cut a big wedge of cardboard.

For the third time, you have no idea what you're talking about.

You can't grab a virtual image from the lens and measure it's size with a ruler, nor do you know the exact focus distance the AVP lens has.

>But if it doesn’t look like 45-degrees of FOV to the user, than what you’re measuring isn’t 45 degrees of FOV.

""Doesn't look like"" is basically ""what the uneducated user doesn't feel is right"". That's more important to you than actual measurement by a professional in the field.

Glasses are the way. There's just too few use cases vs the tradeoffs that you'll get so much more with glasses and headsets.

With the added benefit of economies of scale from all the big players going that direction, the price differential will be massive between them.

korneliuslongshanks,"Ok. Explain to me why those will be good enough then? What is the threshold?

 I'll start.

Battery Life:

How large can the batteries be in a contact lens? Do the batteries need to be flexible? That's fine, doable. What if something happens to the battery? Acid in your eyes. The prototype for the Mojo that they can't even legally insert, they ""claim"" will last up to 2 hours. That's with low levels of brightness, single color, .5 mm with 14000 pixels per inch, at that distance is 280 pixels diameter across. That's their words, but if you've seen it, basically useless outside of basic text display.

Do I think batteries will get better, perhaps a revolutionary change, I certainly hope so, doesn't mean it's possible?

Utility:

We've seen a million heads up display AR products for sports, military, motorcycle helmets in glasses and goggles etc. Extremely low utility. Is it cool to see those things, sure, but there's a reason why they haven't taken off to the mass market, and because it's a novelty. The cool factor wears off quickly especially for the price.

Price:

What do you think the price will have to be to make all these specialty components, especially without the economies of scale? How many do you honestly think they would sell?

Longevity:

How long will they last being semi flexible, immersed in tears, non replaceable batteries. Will they be used for both eyes?

Pixel Density:

To get basic single color pixel density, it takes 14000 pixels per inch. There is only so small we can make things. Have we reached that limit, no, but there is a limit. What would they need to bring color into it, or video, or brighter screens? And increasing those increases the power consumption.

Since you are so sure these won't be an issue because of what?

You go ahead and explain why and how all these things will be solved. How we will have Vision Pro 3,4,5 and Quest Pro 3,4,5 and whatever AR glasses they and all these other big players will have that won't be otherworldly, compared to putting something way less useful and possibly more expensive because it's slightly less cumbersome IN YOUR EYES.","<div class=""md""><p>Ok.

Sometimes it might be something small, like changing a dropdown element on a radio button, but it's your job to understand what will be beneficial in specific cases and be able to advocate for your decisions.

s6x,"If you don't communicate with complete sentences and punctuation, it is a bit difficult to understand what you're saying.

If you want tracked CG hands and CG images composited over photographic imagery, I don't understand why you would want to use a kinect or any similar time of flight/depth system.  Ultraleap is the gold standard for hand tracking.  You could composite your CG on top of imagery you get from a camera mounted to the HMD.

However the latency on consumer webcams is far too high for AR, so you need a low latency camera, probably 20-30ms max: https://www.e-consystems.com/.

Additionally the photographic imagery will be 2d unless you get two cameras and then you're rolling your own stero combination--2d will not work well within a certain range.

The only reason you'd need depth would be for complex occlusion and at that point, with the rest of the above, you're engineering your own AR headset.  Even without that, this is a pretty involved engineering challenge which very few people can do well.  It would certainly cost ten times what a new AVP (let alone a q3) would in time and materials, and you'd end up with something way worse.","<div class=""md""><p>If you don&#39;t communicate with complete sentences and punctuation, it is a bit difficult to understand what you&#39;re saying.</p>

Vitalii_A,"> Putting their head in VR goggles and have them pretend to pet the animal from several meters away is missing the point entirely.

Totally agree, I even not mentioned that because it's like 1+1=2, but maybe a lot of people didn't read that between lines and just focused on my remarks about safety.
Nice that you focused on that point - because 2 days ago I had negative karma for that post even I don't willing insult OP, and actually I'm happy for OP that he able to develop something.
Putting headset on kids in zoo, mostly the same like wearing headset during sex with wife.

And the point with the safety also very simple - human eye have FOV more than any headset, and human eye have resolution bigger than any existing camera able represent, and I even not talking about realtime calculation to show it - but people wearing that headsets and starting cooking (hot pan, etc) or even worse - driving. 
There are a lot of fails compilations in Youtube about VR/MR but people still continue doing strange things.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

Meta is also going to release their EMG device with the Smart glasses and second generation with AR glasses so maybe if there will be Snapdragon Spaces based AR glasses this year i will have to also buy that Meta smart glasses with a screen in 2025 because that EMG device for using the os and typing messages could be worth it compared to full AR glasses.

HiggsFieldgoal,"First of all, there really isn’t a monolithic “AR”.
  
Design, to me, is always about three things:  
  
Input: How a user interacts.  
Information: What is being communicated to the user.  
Aesthetic: How it looks, and more importantly, how it feels to use it.  
  
Bonus 4th thing (although only occasionally relevant):  
Actions: Can the user do real things? Accomplish work, not just absorb information?  
  
And you’re trying to arrange things with an anticipation of the user’s reaction to being presented with interfaces to make something that is intuitive and useful.  
  
AR is just a display technology, superimposing information over the real world. Even then, you have different flavors for additive light pass-through technologies like NReal/Hololens and AR in VR like the Quest3 and Apple Vision Pro.  
  
So even the display side isn’t something solid that you can distinctly quantify.  
  
But, to get to all the other boxes you’ve got to check, you’ve got to understand the input, user intent, and purpose, and all of those explode the number of possibilities and specific challenges related to each of the many AR ecosystems.  
  
Quest has controllers.  
Vision Pro uses hands & eye tracking.  

  
These completely change how you need to design for the platforms.  
  
If you’re just starting out, I’d say you should just pick some AR project on some accessible platform and get started.  
  
You can only really learn “what you don’t know that you don’t know” from experience, trying things, developing a familiarity with the industry.  
  
The initial question is too broad to be worth much. It’s sort of like saying “I’m an engineer struggling to learn cars, and trying to transition to cars. Where should I start?”  
  
If you were trying to get into cars, where would you start?  
  
Buy a car? Start going to car shows? Fix a car? Build a kit car?  
  
And, while I hope that metaphor communicates something of the extent that such a broad topic has no distinct start point, at least cars are fairly defined, as an industry, at this point. “AR” on the other hand is still evolving rapidly and hasn’t settled into any sort of distinct archetypes yet.  
  
So yeah, if you’re really interested, the only thing you can really do is start somewhere… anywhere. You’ve got a phone? You can do some AR on a phone? Want to get into head worn AR, get some sort of HMD, and start there.

wondermega,"You aren't wrong. There's plenty of interesting use cases for AR (industrial, work safety, etc) but no one is really moving on shifting up their infrastructure in a profoundly big way to support any of that just yet - likewise, even though the tech has been making decent strides, the lion's share of the design philosophies required to make it a really good experience are just far too immature. This will take several years to iterate, and unless Meta and Apple and etc keep pushing the needle hard (actually a fair bit more than they currently do, and that's not trying to sound critical) then it will keep moving at a relatively slow rate.

Anyway, that's ok. In spite of my tone, it's a really fascinating place to be right now (although quite difficult for those trying to make real money, yet). As I said the tech is coming along pretty great, and there is a budding community in and around AR. It's just gonna be awhile, but plenty of interesting/novel things are happening for those patient enough to hunt around and contribute. Definitely not ready for mass adoption yet, not by a long shot.

Generally I will say, the kids who grow up with this stuff being more available/""normal"" will take to it more as they grow up, and it will become a lot more meaningful and useful, and integrated into our society. Kind of like how video games kind of existed on the periphery (games and toys category) for a good few decades before it became more acceptable in the mainstream, big business, etc. Of course, with the way things move exponentially faster, I don't expect it to take QUITE that long, but it's not exactly 5 years out, either.","<div class=""md""><p>You aren&#39;t wrong.

The Memojis are 3D models which have what are called “blendshapes”, which is basically a state you want to model to be in with some smooth transitions between states. 

So you would model the character with wide open eyes and a mouth for the “shocked” blendshape. You would then model the eyes and mouth closed for a “sleep blendshape”. You make as many blendshapes as you want. The more the better. 

The blendshapes are then “weighted” so that a value of 1 for the mouth maps to the “open mouth blendshape” and a value of 0 maps to the “closed mouth blendshape”

Then you define the targets for the blendshapes in code. With AR, facial features are tracked in real time and mapped to values. A mouth open is 1, a mouth closed is 0. 

As the user opens and closes their mouth, the blendshape calculation occurs where those input numbers are applied to the blendshape weights.","<div class=""md""><p>I’ll give a super high level, for the sake of simplicity a lot is left out.

It will also be Apple's next move so it could be the Android/iOS mobile contest all over again. Apple don't really have competition over watches or tablets, so this really will be interesting.

I think AVP's weak spot is that its so tied up in the Apple ecosystem. If you're not there already, then its a lot of friction.

quaderrordemonstand,"I agree, competition is always good. At the same time though, I wish they had competing visions rather than just copying results. No reason Apple couldn't copy ideas from Meta, if Meta ever produced an idea worth copying.

I also agree that the ecosystem is a double edged sword. Apple has been carefully building up the developer infrastructure around AR for a while. They have a familiar platform that people trust and many are already invested in. So it reduces a lot of friction for those people.

But the downside is that its an isolated box. It's hard to move data into and out of it, and that is a large part of the potential use case for AR.

But Apple again follows the path of style over real work done. For eg the addition of the eyes on a screen and battery outside. In many of the videos people don't really care about these eyes displaying outside and no one is really interested in talking looking into that fake eye as well. It would be a great design if the battery pack is integrated. Microsoft Hololens did this in 2016 , it should be possible as that battery hanging outside is found to be a big inconvenience for many users.

Sure Marketing is sophisticated enough these days that it can engineer Demand, where it is low or non existent.....if your starting point is a decent product. 

And the original iphones were great products. Way better than what passed for a phone in those day. The Demand Engineers were able to coast off that. Add to that, the top quality Financial Engineering (tax/labor cost/exchange rate/interest rate/govt subsidy arbitrage/supply chain optimization) that Tim Cook represents, and they were able to meet and boost Demand, no technologist or creative type inside Apple ever imagined. 

So we got to see Demand and Financial engineering running at a pace, faster than Technical and Creative innovation. But it was possible only cause the starting point was had a real magical feel too it.

But its hard for these products to replicate that moment. People are already overloaded on magic and novelty. They already have cheap high quality large ass screens.

0v3r_cl0ck3d,"For certain tasks Apple's hardware is significantly better. The Apple Silicon SoCs (M1, M2, M3) all have unified memory, which means that your GPU can access \*all\* of your CPU memory without any performance loss. On Windows if you need to access main system memory from the GPU you have to wait for data to be sent over PCIE which is a big bottle neck if you're doing it frequently.

&#x200B;

My work relies on heavy usage of compute shaders. When I switched from Windows to Mac I got a 10x performance boost in my workflow because I have 64 GB of RAM, which means my GPU has access to 64 GB of VRAM. Having everything in VRAM ready to go massively sped up the software that I use. Although calling it VRAM doesn't really make sense since Apple Silicon doesn't make a distinction between VRAM and RAM. It's just memory that both the CPU and GPU can access simultaneously.

&#x200B;

I can't imagine there are any VR apps that would benefit from this but the Vision Pro does also use Apple Silicon, the exact same chips used in Macs. That is one advantage the Vision Pro has over the Quest 3 since the Quest 3 uses discrete CPU and GPUs with their own memory.

&#x200B;

All this will probably change by the time the Quest 4 comes out though. Qualcom hired most of Apple's engineers after they finished designing the M1 and put them to work on the Snapdragon X SoC.

Eye tracking is not a generational leap, it should have been in quest3.. its its been in several headsets before it. Its simply something that is needed in a modern headset.

But what i'm saying, is that the biggest different still is the resolution. You just need DFR for that resolution. Just like its integrated into the XR4.

I don't know if this is necessarily true. A lot of companies take jabs at their competitor. [Nvidia towards AMD](https://www.techjuice.pk/nvidia-ceo-mocks-amds-new-gpu-calling-its-performance-lousy/), Microsoft towards Apple, Mercedes and Jaguar, Path of Exile mocking Diablo and so on.  Nvidia certainly doesn't see themselves in the number 2 position, and it has never been in the number 2 position. Neither is Diablo more successful in the current arpg space versus POE.

>With that video from Meta and with comments said earlier, they are positioning themselves to be the mass market low price choice for folks that can’t afford AVP.

Are they really? Zuck quite literally stated that he felt his product was better, **period**. Although he, and everyone else who looked at the price difference **initially, would automatically assume** that the Vision Pro is the far superior product merely based on the price, which if true, would make the Quest, indeed, the low price good value choice.

However, technically comparing them, **it's not true**. So, the AVP is only an *overpriced* choice at the moment, not something that technologically vastly outpaces the quest, so much that people only turn to the quest because of it's low price.

Note that the Samsung flagship phones **are not the mass market low price choice for folks that can't afford the iphone.** Just as Windows desktops are not the mass market low price choice for folks who ""can't afford a Mac"".

>they just don’t plan to ever compete on raw quality or performance. They’re conceding that to Apple

Again, I don't know if you watched the same video as me. Zuck says his product is better in quality in some metrics. He also mentioned that the eye tracking input was cool and he planned to integrate it into future models, even going as far as to mention neural interfaces.

>There are definitely trade offs and, for folks that have used neither and tries both, they will come away understanding how much nicer the AVP experience is even with the trade offs (indicating Apple’s made the right ones)

That is not what I have been reading regarding the AVP. A lot of people who've tried both do not agree that the experience as a whole is nicer. It just depends on the specific usage case.

For productivity and integration within the Apple product ecosystem it is without a doubt better.  For those who value immersion (FOV, Pixel Smearing, Comfort), the AVP is a strictly worse product. And yes, there are people who value that. It's why products like the very light bigscreen beyond or the pimax 200fov headsets exist at premium price points.

Again, I would agree with you if it's undisputed that the AVP is just better in every way but ""too expensive"" so people settle with the Quest.

However, that's just not true, and there are many reasons why someone would pick a Quest over an AVP, disregarding the price, and the reason is basically **gaming and entertainment purposes**.

The AVP is utterly and completely defeated in this aspect, even if it costs 7 times more. Meta has invested billions into immersive content and first party titles over the last decade, while Apple's ""VR(spatial computing)"" store is pretty barren at the moment. The metaverse, while not that great at the moment, far outstrips anything Apple has to offer in that space currently (basically nothing).

Same reason why many PC consumers with even a small interest in gaming, get windows PCs/laptops and not Mac products.

>Meta stands to make a LOT of money on being “second best AVP”.

They aren't ""second best AVP"". They are completely different in terms of target audience, just like how Apple computers and Windows computers are marketed to users with difference usage needs.

Again, you are completely bamboozled by the premium price point that Apple has set. ""it is so much more expensive, thus it must be better"". This statement simply isn't true in the VR space. The bigscreen beyond is more than 2 times the price of the Quest 3, but it's lens quality and therefore visual fidelity is much worse due to glare, which is a tradeoff they made for the form factor.

The Quest 3 is not cheap because it uses lousier technology. It is cheap because it is very well cost optimized and subsidized to get VR into the hands of the masses, and is even better than headsets like the Vive that cost more.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

sepease,"You’d need to send all the data from multiple cameras and sensors down to the CPU, process them, then dual 4K+ streams back up to the headset, without any latency or loss. All uncompressed. So you’d need at least two USB4 links for the data going up/down, plus a third for the developer strap.

I’m not even sure if the base M2 chip has three USB4 transceivers.

Plus you’ve got the CPU in somebody’s pocket up against their 95 degree body, with essentially no airflow.

If more sensors are added or the CPU is upgraded, the battery, cable, and the headset needs to be reworked.

And if somebody’s battery pack gets damaged due to the excessive heat, it’s a nominally ~$1000 part instead of $200.

And ultimately the overall heat/power consumption is probably significantly more because you need to drive multiple video streams up and down the entire length of the cable plus add components to demux the signal out to the individual components in the headset. Driving multiple additional data clocks at GHz a second, with all the additional RF shielding and cable weight that entails.","<div class=""md""><p>You’d need to send all the data from multiple cameras and sensors down to the CPU, process them, then dual 4K+ streams back up to the headset, without any latency or loss.

I see no reason why they couldn’t have just made it look like regular glasses like multiple other oems have demonstrated. Instead it seems like they sat down and thought, how can I design this to make you look like the biggest dork possible and this is what they arrived at.</p>

Samsung has the potential but until they decide to treat VR or AR as a standalone platform instead of add-ons for their phones, don’t see them bothering even if they could.

Wise_Rich_88888,"VR has been around for a long time, but it wasn’t until 2015 or so that people started adding cameras to VR headsets to create an AR experience.  In 2016, Apple started adding software to iPhones to allow for more and more AR in the phones, while Oculus added cameras to their headsets.  Note that 2015 also saw the advent of the Hololens, while Google Glass (which was a trash experience) came in 2011.

The Quest series brought around the first device that could do AR in a headset well with the Quest Pro and to more people with the Quest 3, and so Apple actually lost out on their claim to create the first consumer mixed reality device.  

Finally, Feb 2024 the Vision Pro is released.  Invented what now? They have assembled an interesting piece of technology with higher quality than the Quest and spurned the use of the reality terms, instead opting for the term spatial computing, but note that the Quest had hand tracking and eye tracking and did everything that the Vision Pro does, just not as well.

What Apple always brings to the table is a high quality OS with developer oriented tools.  The Quest relied heavily on Unity (so did the Hololens) and android, and positioned itself more in games.

\*Proceeds to rant without understanding what they're responding to\*

>Apple isn’t claiming they’re the inventor here in the slightest.

Tim Cook's literal tweet message: ""We’re so excited for you to experience spatial computing for the first time!""

They literally said they would never use the term ""Metaverse"" publicly, completely refuse to use the phrase AR/VR at all, tell 3rd party developers they cannot utter those words, and instead use a term pretty much nobody else in the industry did. Come on, what do you think is going on here?? Wheter explicitly or implciitly, you don't think they're trying to get the average Joe who has never heard of these phrases to assume Apple is doing something new and different?

Facebook should get shit for regranding AR/VR and gaming into Metaverse and Apple should get shit for pretending they are different because they do ""spatial computing"" instead, it's the same shit.

>Your argument that Apple has absolutely nothing to contribute to the space

Never said anything of the sorts.

>The claim that Apple is a one trick pony really illustrates how ill informed you are. The Apple Watch is the most successful selling watch ever…not the most successful “Smart Watch”, but actual “watch”

Success in sales does not prove they are not a one-trick pony. Supreme sold really well, NFTs sold really well, Prime sells really well, doesn't mean they have anything real to offer that others didn't already. This is not a subreddit about stocks.

>The AirPods product alone generates more revenue than the entirety of Spotify as a business.

Again, numbers don't matter. Just because they can get people to buy a new phone each year, doesn't mean people actually need it. It's marketing, they're marketing machine is so powerful they can turn people like you into fanboys who defend them online for free.

>Apple has demonstrated experience in the following:

* reducing hardware footprint to ridiculous levels,
* designing high resolution displays with low thermals,
* integrating software and hardware together for a cohesive experience.

You're delusional if you think nobody else can do this or you think I'm claiming Apple can't do it too.

The real productivity powerhouse that helps us with multiple computers controlling them all quickly and easily. The Apple Vision Pro is getting even closer to that real possibility, but I wanted something more open, and more cross platform.

If that's a problem with text-based comments, it'll a war with simulation-based comments. Rather, the nature of these simulations must be solely determined by a combination of the comment, some pre-defined and mods-approved text summary of the commenter, and the post's content. The visuals of the simulation should strive to primarily represent the post with consideration for the general preferences of the commenter. If the post was about how archaeologists recently discovered a long lost king's tomb, a part of your room, through the vision pro, would render a living, breathing, holographic representation of archaeologists digging out the tomb. However, if the comment from which the sim is generated says something like, ""your mama is older than that king,"" the hologram would probably show a king with feminine features and the archaeologists kissing his hands and acting chivalrous or something like that. (Depends on model training.) In a way, it's like newspapers comics or political cartoons. The point is that arbitrariness is successfully curbed on the platform. Even more important is that spatial readers of posts would get a sensual and fuller feel of the stances of commenters and the larger subreddit community, based on the intrigue or seriousness or comedic quality of the rendered holograms.

I needed to do that for my son because it helped alleviate any uncomfortability from sensory issues with a headset on his head and touching his face/ears.

Props for the endeavor and share progress if you like!","<div class=""md""><p>Sounds like an awesome idea! I like making things for my son who is special needs, too.  One thing you might consider, too, is making an app for mobile devices (think phones, tablets, etc).</p>

Saltwater-Coffee,"Thank you! I appreciate you and I'm glad you're making things for your son. If you don't mind sharing, what are some resources that have been helping him or that you've utilized for school or vocational settings? 

Most of my students enjoy the sensory feedback. A lot of them utilize things like weighted blankets, noise cancelling/quiet headphones, and etc. not all of them. Some will throw their hearing aids or glasses off. But a lot of them respond well to it. So I'm keeping my fingers crossed it will not bother a lot of students. It won't be a catch-all, but I'll keep working with the students that don't respond to it. 

I actually started working on an app for them before I realized what I was making already existed. But I'm definitely open to making something. Do you have any ideas of apps that don't exist that would help your son? I have a small background in game design, software, behavioral health and occupational therapy, and a few other odds and ends. I think I have the skills to tie together something nice. I'm still in the building block phases. I'm leaning on getting a quest 3 and jumping in wherever I can.

TheStilken,"Oh yea! He definitely likes sensory feedback like a weighted vest, blanket, and he LOVES just carrying around small, colorful objects.

I'm actually playing around with something right now using OpenCV and Tesseract(think object/text recognition), and used my laser to cut out a small wooden ""magnifying glass"" with a viewing hole in it and some fun designs on it.

The idea is that the kids can wear a set of funny looking frames with a small camera feeding the visual data to a small device(maybe a bookmark or reading stand) and only the text in the window will be read aloud.  Kind of an interesting way to practice sight reading(at least in my head lol).

I've got most of it working, but still a ways to go.

For the resources, he gets Speech, Occupational, ABA(I know it's kind of controversial to some, but we monitor sessions closely and have it to help him learn basic life skills), and PT.

Maybe a game that can help with OT or PT? Like augmented reality models leading an easy exercise routine or again, life skills things? 

Off rip, maybe just a virtual ""calming"" sensory environment with colors and sounds that you can supplement with physical feedback.","<div class=""md""><p>Oh yea! He definitely likes sensory feedback like a weighted vest, blanket, and he LOVES just carrying around small, colorful objects.</p>

totesnotdog,"So with transparent glass displays they use what is called wave guide displays they are effectively bouncing projected light into your eyes. Much like HoloLens 2, but the downside to this is there is no such thing as black light. Only tinted white light. So wave guide displays render black as transparent and can only go so dark with certain colors meaning that another downside is they cannot blend realistic darks of shadows of the AR projections they do. 

This is why you see richer shadows on MR pass through on mixed reality devices that don’t use wave guide displays. I also assume apple is aware of that limitation of wave guides and chose screen pass through instead.

Edit: personally I like getting to use wave guide displays and would be down for some AR glasses that used them but the reality is they wouldn’t be able to do such rich dark colors and there may be some subtle transparency on stuff with really bright backgrounds but this isn’t really all that bad. As long as the projections are bright enough they usually pop well agains the background unless the background is extremely bright too.

<p>Note* there are a few other types of AR glasses displays such as birdbath displays</p>

You can't just have a transparent screen there, the image also needs to be lensed so its focus point is further away from your eyes. That's why all current AR glasses have a reflection based screen.

100%. You can have up to three digital screens up at the same time as though they were regular monitors on Quest 3. Yes, you can drag them around and resize them as you fit.

While I don't personally use it for work, you can easily link a Bluetooth keyboard to the headset and use one of the many office work-oriented apps that have released in Quest stores. It's just a matter of companies adapting their workspaces to using AR/VR/MR headsets for computer work.

In short, yes, you can replace your computer with the Quest 3 depending on what you're using it for. Quest 3 can fully replace your computer in terms of casual Internet use and basic computer work.

In the last weeks, as part of the Exight Team, I worked on an AR experience for smartphones where I had the pleasure of creating and animating the 3D scene elements. This video is the target rendering we used as the art direction for the AR programming. The catch is that the experience doesn’t need an installation on device and is compatible with most smartphones and AR headsets. We will also optimize the experience for future devices such as Apple’s Vision Pro. Stay tuned and check out Exight\`s Website for more information:

It has a bit lower resolution than the MagicLeap but a higher Field of View, so maybe it's good enough for viewing 3D models as holograms, although I never tried it so I cannot tell.

They have their differences vs other platforms you build software for, but unless you want to restrict yourself, I would advise picking one aspect and starting there as a career.

Caveat is, it's commonly a lot of code and learning to be done compared to social AR platforms.

I think the platform with the least update is Snapchat with Lens Studio. I don't know about EffectHouse but SparkAR requires updates and maintenance every few months or so, sometimes they allow you to just update it in one click while other times where they have a big update, you'll need to open it in a new version and just re-export it.

I'm not sure about how Adobe Aero updates though, but as far as I'm using it, it doesn't require any updates so far, so I guess that'll be your best bet.

MakakaOrg,"I am a Unity Developer. I am primarily interested in the capabilities of the engine and its performance.

Furthermore, I am not an ""advocacy"" of Unity, I just use it because it's better for AR Development right now, based on my Experience of Creating [complete AR Projects](https://makaka.org/ar).

# Performance

Unity can be run on every machine for development. When I tried to experiment with Unreal, I faced with high requirements for hardware for a standard 3rd-person scene.

So Unreal, is not suitable for medium and weak laptops in long-term development (especially for video recording of your screen at the same time if you need it), but Unity suits: at the moment of Unity 2022.3 — relevant version for now for production.

# Testing

With Unity AR Foundation 5 and its [XR Simulation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@5.1/manual/xr-simulation/simulation.html), you can test AR apps right in Unity Editor. If you need fast testing with a real device experience, so there are [some Unity Assets](https://makaka.org/unity-tutorials/ar-testing) you can use.

# WebGL

The AR Foundation doesn't support websites for now, but you can use WebGL with the [next Unity Assets](https://forum.unity.com/threads/ar-for-webgl-with-unity.1412541/).","<div class=""md""><p>I am a Unity Developer.

BootsyRootsy,"It's definitely achievable! And I feel you pain, knowing what you want to do and wandering out into the constantly shifting sands of AR programming and implementation.

A few years ago my MRP (Masters Research Project) I needed to build an AR prototype experience. So many platforms, so much expertise needed... what to choose? I found YouTube tutorials that demonstrated how to build the functionality I needed in Unity and I was able to realize my vision... I NEVER could have gotten there without the tutorials!

But then came the 'distribution' part (this was in 2019). Publish an app that people would then have to download? Nobody wants to download an app, especially standing at a table amid fifty other presentations just to see one thing. So I made a video recording (screen recording) of the functionality running in Unity and presented THAT - my presentation board had still pictures taken from the video recording, the physical model (scale model of a park) that triggered and anchored the AR was sitting on the table. I published the video to Vimeo and generated a QR code that 'pointed' to it. I printed the QR code and put it on the table beside the model. When people scanned the code it opened the video RECORDING that I had made in Unity of the functionality working - they saw the AR experience, but it wasn't actually 'happening' in their phones. Still, with the model sitting there, it was enough for them to ""ooh"" and ""aah"".

The technologies have updated a LOT since then, and it's much, much easier to model and implement an AR experience. I'm in the same spot you are (again), working on my PHD dissertation which extends what I did in my masters. Once again, I've been navigating the various technologies to figure out how to build my experience. I can do a video recording demo of the functionality again, but there has been a major development that means nobody has to download an app - **new smartphones can do AR right in the web browser, and you can trigger it/download the content through a QR code**. This is, of course, a much more interactive and impressive way to go. I am still researching it myself; maybe we can 'buddy up' on findings. Start by googling ""AR in web smartphone browser HTML5"".

But to catch you up, here's what I've found so far:

1. This company is doing a good job. Go here [https://ar-code.com](https://ar-code.com) and use your phone's camera to scan their demo codes on that first page. They operate on a subscription model, of course.

The Google (Android) and Apple (iPhone) ""kits"" that allow the functionality are free, and there are lots of articles, demos and tutorials on how to build the HTML5 yourself. Things like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v\_Uj0C8sMi4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_Uj0C8sMi4) I've only started figuring this stuff out, but it looks promising. I will likely try to build my own thing, but if it gets too frustrating I'll end up picking one of the many, many AR building and publishing platforms and paying. I may end up trying Unity again, but that's not a very friendly piece of software if you don't use it all the time like a game developer or something.

SO! The good news is that AR implementation and publishing is available to people like you and me now (non expert, non programmers). The even better news is that new smartphones can experience what we make without downloading an app, just by scanning a QR code (which is easy to generate for free) that points to a webpage you've published, the AR happening via HTML5.

There are a lot of people in this sub that actually know what they're doing. Hopefully somebody will read what I've written here and point us to something even better and free (or really affordable).","<div class=""md""><p>It&#39;s definitely achievable!

I can do a video recording demo of the functionality again, but there has been a major development that means nobody has to download an app - <strong>new smartphones can do AR right in the web browser, and you can trigger it/download the content through a QR code</strong>. This is, of course, a much more interactive and impressive way to go. I am still researching it myself; maybe we can &#39;buddy up&#39; on findings. Start by googling &quot;AR in web smartphone browser HTML5&quot;.</p>

<p>But to catch you up, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve found so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>This company is doing a good job. Go here <a href=""https://ar-code.com"">https://ar-code.com</a> and use your phone&#39;s camera to scan their demo codes on that first page. They operate on a subscription model, of course.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Google (Android) and Apple (iPhone) &quot;kits&quot; that allow the functionality are free, and there are lots of articles, demos and tutorials on how to build the HTML5 yourself. Things like this: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_Uj0C8sMi4"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_Uj0C8sMi4</a> I&#39;ve only started figuring this stuff out, but it looks promising. I will likely try to build my own thing, but if it gets too frustrating I&#39;ll end up picking one of the many, many AR building and publishing platforms and paying. I may end up trying Unity again, but that&#39;s not a very friendly piece of software if you don&#39;t use it all the time like a game developer or something.</p>

<p>SO! The good news is that AR implementation and publishing is available to people like you and me now (non expert, non programmers). The even better news is that new smartphones can experience what we make without downloading an app, just by scanning a QR code (which is easy to generate for free) that points to a webpage you&#39;ve published, the AR happening via HTML5.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people in this sub that actually know what they&#39;re doing. Hopefully somebody will read what I&#39;ve written here and point us to something even better and free (or really affordable).</p>

realityPioneer,"A bit hard to answer specifically without more details. A JS developer could learn enough Unity to get a project up and running in an hour — or it could take years depending on the complexity of the work. Unity’s initial learning curve is manageable but it’s got a long tail. 

This is especially true for AR, where there’s a lot of nuance and difficulty that’s not specific to Unity. But again, this is highly dependent on the app itself. An AR app to place a miniature model on a table is pretty straightforward, but one that has high-accuracy spatial alignment at building scale is much, much harder. And you’re likely to have to use a 3rd party SDK to achieve that, depending on your requirements.

What device(s) are you targeting? That influences all of your questions as well. Unity is generally a great framework for AR, and very likely you can achieve your goal with it.

<p>I totally agree with you when you mentioned that it may be difficult for users to find any real value if the barrier to accessing the tech to run it is too high.</p>

Faster interaction with the UI (I personally think voice is always going to be awkward and clumsy, typing is nicer, but not in the way it is implemented in something like a Quest headset. And I haven't used eye-tracking and so can't have an informed opinion on it).

With all that said though, sometimes I ask myself why would someone go through the hassle? Why step into a minigame with a 3d environment of a retail shop when browsing the website would be faster? Now the answer in my opinion is that these experiences won't be happening in a 3d replica of a retail shop, just a supercharged website sort of thing.

Next level 👍 Powered by Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1. Up to 8 hours battery life. Can be connected to a smart phone and supports Flyme Link to use the phone's compute  - does this only work with Snapdragon 8 Gen 3? Idk. Prescription inserts and a magnetic sun visor can be attached, as far as I understand. What about the monochrome MYVU though?

Application-wise, the Discovery Edition has a TikTok app, while the monochrome MYVU does not. Both can be used for realtime translation, navigation, QQ Music player, etc. and access to a LLM (Flyme AI by Meizu).

&#x200B;

>how can I apply AR without downloading various applications or having the scan itself open via the browser

The problem is that devices don't currently have built-in functionality to load 3D content without either using the browser or a custom app.

See [http://qrcode.meetheed.com/qrcode\_examples.php](http://qrcode.meetheed.com/qrcode_examples.php). Many people have phones that will display these basic data types after scanning a QR code, but they are not what you need.

Having said that, there's a company [https://ar-code.com/](https://ar-code.com/) that's trying to cater to experiences kind of like what you want. I've never used it, but it looks like their default experience won't keep the reader in the flow the way you want. Still, you might want to check it out, or even reach out to them. They might be able to give you tips on how to best incorporate their solution.

&#x200B;

Alternatively, I suspect you need a custom app to create the best experience. But you may not have the resources to do that for a student project?

I'm envisioning a custom app running with the camera pointed at the book, like with a phone mounted on a stand. A headset could work better if you can assume that for your audience. The user would open the app when they start reading the book. The app would continuously scan the pages for some cue, like QR codes, and render the appropriate 3D character in AR whenever it detects a cue.

Nevertheless, for a student project, you might be better off using the camera to scan QR codes and load the content from a website. It won't be as smooth, but I suspect it will be more doable to set up a custom website to host your 3D content. Just simple pages for each character with a ""View in AR"" button. Or using AR Code would be even less smooth, but easier. Which is helpful since I assume the art will be a lot of work already.

Of course if you can get a skilled app developer to help you, that might change the calculation.","<div class=""md""><p>I think I understand what you&#39;re envisioning, where someone points a device at the book and 3D content instantly pops up in AR.

Dudevid,"I'm someone who has spent years in all these spaces except fashion design. This is a very diverse set of interests so I can only provide very high-level advice:

1. Graphics programming: amazing if you love art and have a technical background, but it might be more maths focused than merely 'technology'. How're your maths skills lookin'? Specifically geometry, trig, vector spaces, linear algebra, and some aspects of probability/statistics (e.g. noise patterns, Gaussian distributions)? This stuff is eminently learnable and so much fun to learn if you also love maths. And highly rewarding too if you're of an artistic bent and achieve something you visualised that at first was seemingly impossible.
2. Full-stack web dev: yeah, I think you've already realised this isn't for you. High paid careers are available if you pursue this but it's unlikely to pay off if you also want to explore 3D art. There are some high-paid jobs and rewarding careers out there exploring 3D art on the web and the space is expanding with things like Three.js and WebGL but this is a riskier option if you want to pay the bills and live well, at least right now.
3. UX: the explosion of UX as a field in the late noughties/early 2010s meant that a designer's mind coupled with a psychologist's knack for user motivations constituted an individual likely to find a promising career, but again UX was until fairly recently centred around web dev/design. And I don't think web dev is for you.
4. VR UX: this is a really exciting field, and so much around VR with regards to UX remains fairly unestablished. Simple UX questions around how to rotate viewpoints in VR, how to translate in VR, how to interact with VR worlds which adapt to existing human spaces like homes etc. are _still_ entirely up for grabs. If you are technical and artistic but also demonstrate aptitude when it comes to rapid prototyping new UX schemes in a fairly nascent medium, then you will find a rewarding career here.
5. AR UX: this is related to VR UX, but there's a crucial difference I think. AR is the future UI of AI. If you're interested in advancements of AI, there will be an explosion of (speaking generally here) new tools, utilities, quality of life upgrades. More and more, as we humans learn to live with the future of AI, we will look for ways to integrate it into our lifes to benefit us in the lowest friction way. The lowest friction integration is for it live in the world with us.

I would ask you to consider AR UX, but I acknowledge that initially your design thirst may be unquenced. For ultimate art thirst quenching coupled with solid technical understanding, I'd say go with graphics programming. Finally, I would ask you to consider a career in video games, potentially even starting a new studio. That's what I did. Games needs almost all of the above.","<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m someone who has spent years in all these spaces except fashion design.

Formal_Salt2667,"Thanks for such a thorough reply!

I love to create things from concept upwards, thats what I find hugely rewarding which is why I loved being a character concept artist (did this for 6 months for childrens books)  I was given the story script and i came up with the designs. I enjoyed full stack web dev because of the creative problem solving and the logic of it but it felt too boxed-in when it came to coding for other people because it wasn't my concept or idea. When I worked in fashion design, again I loved the problem solving but the designs were always dictated to me by management/clients. The only time I felt free with it was at university when I could conceptualise and create. I used to use 3D modelling software as a fashion designer (APEX and CLO) which I found interesting too. To answer your question about maths, I was good at it at school but didn't find it engaging until university when I needed it for fashion design! I loved that problem solving to create the image in my mind irl.

&#x200B;

I've done some research on UX and the general consensus seems to be that it can get quite monotonous because theres only so much variation to a website or app layout. Plus the concept is already dictated. So I'm starting to question this route.

&#x200B;

I am super interested in games and the VR/AR world within that! I want to make sure I pick a future-proof degree that won't lead me into another oversaturated market (like fashion and junior web devs) because there are so many artists out there and not as many that can do both technical and arty. So I want to play to my strengths whilst leaving enough room for creative expression.","<div class=""md""><p>Thanks for such a thorough reply!</p>

You can load models, textures and what not from files at runtime, so that bit should be easy. I haven't looked into the code side of it yet. Theoretically you could pre-compile all of the code for your plugin, and then load the compiled code into the master application at runtime, but I'm not sure if that is actually possible in Unity. If that's not possible, you could implement a scripting language such as Lua, and expose important internal functions. You could then load the scripts from text files at runtime and basically have a script in the master application that just goes ""if the script says move an object, then execute this code that moves an object"", etc.

I think in theory you could then make it a more ""complete"" experience by make the master app a launcher (the app that handles homescreens and launching apps in Android, which is user replaceable), and then provide a way for individual apps to send data to it to set up 3D models and scripts and stuff. This would basically turn an android device into a device that works as you described (you would probably also want to make sure standard applications could be launched and appear as a window in the scene). I don't plan to take things that far though, I would be happy with just an application that I could extend at runtime with plugins.","<div class=""md""><p>The idea would be that you would have one master application that managed the scene, and then smaller plugins that you could load into the master application.

Also, I would like an option to fix the screen on a wall so the experience would be just like watching TV, turn my head and the screen stays where it was, not following my head everywhere I turn. I am close to pulling the trigger on a 75&quot; OLED but if I could get smart glasses that are comfy and can work like this I would probably never buy a real TV again.</p>

EmergencyAd8321,"I am with you there. I’ve been interested in this space for a while. There are too many to choose from. There’s a podcast called the “AR Show” which has great content and gives some insight into the AR market as a whole. 
From the hardware standpoint I think Apple is going the hardest, so place some stock in Apple as a general measure.  The sleeping giant is Instagram (Meta) with software, but they curate and censor content on their platforms so there’s no real customization and will stifle creativity. Unless you like to put puppy dog eyes and knowing what Simpson character you are, the socials look like they won’t go that far as far as software usage for the masses.  Both of these are expensive to invest in and won’t give as much of a return on investment as the market cap is already pretty extended. If I had invested earlier than I did, I would be way better off. Although investment in the big names in the AR space will ultimately give a return, most of them don’t have much of an ROI anymore unless you already have a ton of money and day trade. 
Cobalt futures are worth a look as the battery consumption space will take off when we have the cable free eyewear. 
As far as startups, there are a couple that I’m looking into for my portfolio. One called Glyph that can place textures on virtually any object and allows for the digital content to bend with the material, even if it’s torn apart or at an odd and perpendicular angles.  Although the actual physical object has all these little “scales” in them that look like polkadots. Not sure it will be advantageous for the mass consumer but it’s a game changer for prototyping and seeing what objects would look like with customization in showroom settings. I’m waiting for them to open an investment round. 
The other startup I came across is called PublishAR who seems to be where the industry would be heading for public adoption in marker based AR. Users choose any tangible image and place digital content on it by pressing a button. They did a live demo really quick on stage at a tech event in San Diego.  They were demonstrating it for ad agencies and general user home photography/print products. If this one takes off, it could be huge. They are opening a pre-seed round in December, so I’m going to throw a few bucks at it. Maybe think about hitting these two up? I think they both have legs and are different from everything I’ve seen in the AR space. 
Happy hunting!","<div class=""md""><p>I am with you there. I’ve been interested in this space for a while. There are too many to choose from. There’s a podcast called the “AR Show” which has great content and gives some insight into the AR market as a whole.

xr_melissa,"I recently saw a designer showing off a cool looking concept of a 3D object emerging from the movie screen so the user could look at and manipulate it. It was a cool interaction—like extracting a piece of the movie to touch with your own hands! But it made me question some things.

Wouldn't that direct your attention away from the movie? What value does spinning a 3D object in front of you add to the experience?

It certainly depends on the exact use case (which I'm happy to discuss!). But in my case, I wanted to look at this idea from the standpoint of how 3D objects (or ""augments"" in Meta terms) would enhance the immersion of the movie watching experience.

For this, I used a scene from the Studio Ghibli film ""Princess Mononoke"" where tree spirits (kodama) start appearing in the forest.  The concept is that, in a mixed reality movie experience, creatures and elements of the environment within the movie could gradually appear/disappear in your space to give you a closer sense of ""being there"" without the complication of trying to craft an entire 3D VR scene.

This is my first stab at the concept with a Photoshop mockup, so my next step is to animate this to really give it the right feel.

Should it be interactive, though? If so, how much is enough? That's my question. I personally think it would be compelling to have a little kodama appear sitting on my knee and shaking his little hand. But something like being able to ""touch"" and sway the fireflies/glowing orbs might be just simple enough to provide that sense of awe without being distracting. What do you think?","<div class=""md""><p>I recently saw a designer showing off a cool looking concept of a 3D object emerging from the movie screen so the user could look at and manipulate it.

I agree that adding 3D objects just because you can isn't a good strategy. So my thought with this concept I showed in the image (which would be better communicated once animated) is a subtle and gradual appearance/disappearance of 3D objects that evoke a sense of being in the same environment as the movie scene depicts. So gradual, slow transitions rather than stark changes. Like when a movie slowly fades between scenes, but even slower. So perhaps the kodama could be something to edit out and the plants/fireflies/dimmed lights would be sufficient?

The amount of augmentation could also be something the user can adjust, similar to how the AVP has the reality crown to dial in the amount of MR/VR immersion.

Because I could imagine that although some people may want to Google some additional info while watching sports, others might find it distracting. So there likely isn't one ""proper"" way.

But thank you for providing your two cents! I like the discussion. When I posted this on LinkedIn most people just said, ""That's cool!"" but I'd like to actually discuss it lol","<div class=""md""><p>Specific use cases and user preferences are definitely a good consideration here.</p>

I have the XREAL Air 1 and I like it. I don't use it for all of my work, more so when I go to cafes or on planes when traveling (which is frequent enough) so I can lay back a little while doing some work. For me it's usually an hour or so at a time, not all day, though.

Personally, I think it's very clear, especially when comparing it to my Quest Pro. The FoV of the XREAL Air is small (for both 1 and 2, the FoV is the same) but the resolution is great.

Your title mentions walking away from the connected computer. The Beam can connect to certain devices wirelessly, but it can be hit or miss. For me, the Windows beta stuff doesn't work with my work laptop, which is a Dell Precision. You might want to ask in r/XREAL or their Discord to get specific confirmation on that. Because if you use it wired, you'll either have to unplug it each time (which will reset display settings the same way when a monitor disconnects) or just take them off.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

xr_melissa,"The concept is interesting from a theoretical point of view, but I have two main issues with it:

(1) It seems premature to start adding specific terms to sensory input that is not yet standard to XR experiences. Few commercial third party devices for taste and smell, for example, even exist. So only very niche developers might be making experiences for it. ""Ushering in a new era"" is extremely hyperbolic here for something almost no one knows about.

(2) The intent here seems to be a way to soothe the experience of the outside world for people with sensory issues or perhaps a neurotypical person who wants some peace and quiet. Which is all well and good. But allowing reality to be *altered* rather than *augmented* is a slippery slope imo

Don't get me wrong; I'm all for cool sensory research in XR.

wigitty,"Using any random webcam for AR is quite hard. Most AR devices have either more than one camera or a depth camera so they can get 3D information, as well as having IMUs (Intertial Measurement Units). If you are using just one camera, you need to know the properties of the camera so you can correct for lens distortion, and then you can potentially construct an understanding of the environment based on motion or by tracking a known marker. So just relying on one webcam and without asking your users to calibrate it (not sure if that is an option for you), your options and results will be limited.

That being said, you could look into Vuforia (I seem to remember they did single camera marker based AR), or write your own system with OpenCV. I am not aware of any other tools, but there may be more.","<div class=""md""><p>Using any random webcam for AR is quite hard.

dropsAR,"hey there, I have some first hand experience with having initially launched as a geolocation based audio app, ""pokemon go for music"" around 2017. Ultimately we pivoted to a full AR platform with audio as a feature alongside 3d content and have seen a much better response from customers. 

A few lessons that we learned with Augmented Audio : 

\- it's really hard to get people to install an app and then go to a specific location to discover music. The marketing funnel shrinks really fast, even if you're working with an artist that has a large following.

\- if it's curated content, it takes a lot of time and energy to create that content.

\- music, even pre-released music,  isn't enough of an incentive for people to go to a geofenced place. Especially when they can wait a few days for it to drop on a streaming service.

\- spatial audio guides and compasses are cool but people feel much more comfortable with a visual map.

\- at the end of the day, for us, audio became part of the experience, not the whole thing. Music offers cross-collaboration opportunities but there needed to be more for users to engage with.

I think there are plenty of creative opportunities ahead with Apple SpatialOS and Oculus. I know of an app called HearHere that is meant for roadtrips. I also remember Foursquare experimented with an idea called Marsbot. And in 2018 Bose had acquired a walking tour company called Detour for their failed BoseAR glasses.

hope that helps!","<div class=""md""><p>hey there, I have some first hand experience with having initially launched as a geolocation based audio app, &quot;pokemon go for music&quot; around 2017.

I can imagine such geolocative apps is a difficult market, especially without visuals. A friend of mine has recently launched a geolocative social audio sharing app, I guess a bit similar to your original idea. He's been reporting similar challenges. :-/

I don't know how it was in 2017, but a bit later I think there became this slight hype of social audio apps (e.g. Clubhouse), and podcasts and audio books became popular... so I think (want to believe) people are getting a bit more accustomed to audio-only content. Though it's a slow trend.

I know HearHere, too, and it's almost a miracle if it's profitable business, but I really hope so. Probably audio is still considered somehow secondary to visuals, so people don't want to make an effort or *detour* to get just audio content, but either enjoy it while doing something else (like driving car from point A to B) or want to get some visuals with the audio (like in concerts, or in your app).","<div class=""md""><p>Thanks, very valuable insight!</p>

Google Maps also makes it easier to understand your surroundings once you get somewhere — like if you’re exiting a subway station and need to orient yourself or if you’re scoping out a new neighborhood and need to find the nearest coffee shop. Lens in Maps (formerly called Search with Live View) uses AI and augmented reality to help you quickly acclimate yourself — whether you’re navigating a new city or discovering local hidden gems.  
Simply tap the Lens icon in the search bar and lift your phone to find information about nearby ATMs, transit stations, restaurants, coffee shops and stores. In our biggest expansion of this feature yet, starting this week Lens in Maps is coming to more than 50 new cities including A​​ustin, Las Vegas, Rome, São Paulo and Taipei.

>**Know before you go with Immersive View for Routes**  
Google Maps provides over 20 billion kilometers of directions every day. And with AI, we’re reimagining how you plan your trips before you go. At I/O this year, we announced [Immersive View for routes](https://blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-updates-io-2023/), an entirely new way to preview every step of your journey — whether you’re driving, walking or cycling. This week, Immersive View for routes starts rolling out in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Dublin, Florence, Las Vegas, London, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Paris, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Tokyo and Venice on Android and iOS.  
\[...\]  
All of this builds on our work for [Immersive View for places](https://blog.google/products/maps/sustainable-immersive-maps-announcements/), which uses AI to fuse together billions of Street View and aerial images so you can know what a restaurant or landmark is like before you go. Now developers can also create their own immersive experiences with the launch of [Photorealistic 3D Tiles in Google Maps Platform](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/maps-platform/build-immersive-maps-at-scale-with-photorealistic-3d-2d-and-street-view-tiles-now-in-ga) this week.

Yes, model viewer for WebAR, QR code for site link. 

Question for you:
How do you create landing page with sketchfab? You can embed 3d model with sketchfab. Can’t create landing page.

It's also best to start a product from the simplest possible viable thing to do. Since IMO my variation on your idea is viable, you could start there.

incognoscente,"From your initial question, you want a device that is not currently quite available. You have to decide what is most important - form factor or function. And more specifically, if you prioritize form factor (as your initial question leads me to believe), then a more explicit understanding of what you'd like to do with the glasses because very important to guide you through the candidate devices. So, perhaps you can explain more what you want to do with them?

Meanwhile, let me lay down some options:

**Standalone ultra lightweight devices:**

**Vuzix Ultralite** (see my other response in this thread about those specifically) - simple small FoV monocular display - no sensors (camera, mic., etc.)  
**Ray-Ban Stories 2** \- no display, but! When they enable use of on device camera with voice interaction to Meta AI (multimodal input - expected Q2 2024), this is going to be an incredibly interesting device (literally visual search everywhere you go.). Also nifty live-streaming function. Few people will even know you're wearing ""AR"" glasses.

**Tethered ""sunglass style"" lightweight 3DoF devices:**

**XReal Air / Air 2 / Air 2 Pro** \- one of the better options if you just want a big virtual display. Support for SteamDeck, PC, Mac, etc via low cost Xreal Beam accessory or you can use a compatible mobile phone. The last 2 devices were just released in China so you might have to wait a bit to get them elsewhere - or you could go with the original Air.  
**Rokid Max** \- Rokid has been a strong competitor to Xreal (aka NReal) and their product is comparable but perhaps less software support.

**Functional middleweight 6DoF devices:**

**Lenovo ThinkReality A3** \- tethered to a mobile phone (which has to be Snapdragon Spaces compatible). Way more functional than any of the devices listed above with an outstanding display. Costs more, weighs more, gives you more. Support for Qualcomm **Snapdragon Spaces** (an emerging middleware standard) opens you up to a wide range of cool apps.

There will be a bunch more devices in this category coming out - probably at **CES 2024** in January. If you're not in a hurry, you might want to wait until then to decide if this is the class of device you're interested in.","<div class=""md""><p>From your initial question, you want a device that is not currently quite available.

AugmentedRobotics," Hi OP, here are a few AR glasses that could be recommended:

1. **Nreal Air:**  lightweight AR glasses designed for everyday use. It is also reasonably priced. 
2. **Rokid Air:** also lightweight AR glasses that are designed for everyday use. They have a resolution of 1920x1080 and are also relatively affordable.
3. **Magic Leap 1:** more expensive, but it offers better image quality and a wider field of view than the Nreal Air or Rokid Air. Its resolution and field of view are much much better BUT it is bulkier and has a shorter battery life.

For a broke student, 1 or 2 is more recommended! Hope this helps :))","<div class=""md""><p>Hi OP, here are a few AR glasses that could be recommended:</p>

Sankin2004,"Stay away from Inmo. A lot of what your looking for is what I’m looking for and Inmo air 2 promised to be all of these things. The problem is after finally getting some trusted reviews the device actually falls short on a lot of the proffered amenities. First when I tried to buy it, I’ve gone two almost three weeks without a word about my purchase other than the initial email sayin this is what you purchased, despite my attempted contacts. Speaker quality is garbage unless you don’t mind everyone around you hearing what you hear(no Bluetooth headphone support whatsoever). Super short battery life and your not able to use while charging. And most of the phone connectivity things they talk about are busted, laggy, or crashes often. Some of the in built apps work really great, but the external microphone quality is not good(for translating in real time-it can’t really hear the other person so well). It’s an android operating system with development features, so you might be able to build/connect some other apps if your a developer, but otherwise your stuck with a pretty poor selection of inbuilt apps. The $600 price tag looks good when compared with like the vision pro coming out at almost $4000. And the best feature of course is the no cables needed to run anything, with the ability to connect to wifi and use either gestures or the ring device to move and select items. But overall it promised to be the poor man’s vision pro and falls quite substantially below the mark. 

Otherwise pretty much everything else your going to run into something you have to compromise over, or just wait a while longer to see what new comes out. The two biggest issues you will run into are the price tag, or needing to be connected to something with cables(thereby destroying the covert glasses look). Your also going to run into issues with phone connectivity if you don’t have a newerish android phone(so far nothing has good support for iPhone without extra adapters and cables). On these devices you’ll also be limited to your phones battery life which will drain much faster than normal with little salvation unless you get even more adapters more cables and an external battery. 

**TLDR**    
There really isn’t anything out at the moment that hits all the points your looking for. And whatever you do stay away from Inmo air 2.","<div class=""md""><p>Stay away from Inmo.

duckymomo21,"yeah i guess i did ask a bit much, what i mainly want from these glasses are a display that i could preferably stream to wirelessly ( i have no idea if that's feasible ), and have a display that can integrate into the system i already have (a google pixel 6 and chromebook). The other main important piece is that the glasses have to be subtle and go under the radar in school, i wouldnt be allowed to wear sunglasses but can get away with glasses that look normal but are maybe a tiny bit bulkier as long as the lenses are not tinted. Other things like audio quality or cameras are added bonuses. I would also like the possibility of connecting my consoles to them however ik that they have to be wired in order do soto  would preferably be both wireless and wired.

Id mainly use them for class and to increase the amount of monitors i could have in class. They would also be used whilst im at work for a live translate feature as ive seen examples of this feature in use and id like to know what the customers are saying in their native language, which is again why they have to look like normal glasses.

If you don't mind to clarify these two points:

>First of all, I tried again their AR glasses prototype and noticed that **the quality of the holograms looked improved.** They  seemed less noisy than my first experience with them.

By noise, do you mean like laser projector speckle? [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle\_(interference)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle_(interference))

>**the 3D holograms were a bit transparent all looked like made of very noisy little colored dots**

AR translucency can usually be controlled by increasng brightness, if that is what you mean.

By little colored dots, do you mean the pixels/voxels had noticeable gap? This could be either due to their FLCoS display having large pixel gaps (small pixel fill factor) or the display not producing enough focal planes and the separation being due to pixels being on different focal planes. One way to be sure would be to check if it is still present on a flat object/image (such as GUI) displayed by it that your eyes are perpendicular to.

AugmentedRobotics,"That's an interesting challenge and I hope you succeed in this endeavor! As many people have pointed out this is no easy task! How I would go about this is to:

* Develop an algorithm that translates a scanned text into a unique but simple identifier. Eg.: you could identify the 10 rarest words/names per page (probably it will have to be more clever than that)
* Now parse the pdf of the book page by page and get the descriptor for every page to build up your database.
* Now in your app: scan any page of the book by using an available OCR plugin for unity and extract the text on the page.
* Apply your algorithm on this scanned text as well to get the unique identifier and compare it to your database.
* If you are lucky you will know exactly which page you are looking at.
* There are many ways this can easily get more difficult. but I believe one might find solutions for all of them:
* Your scanning is not perfect: in that case, write a more robust comparison algorithm that will propose a list of the most likely pages. if there is no 100% match. Maybe the most important word is missing well if words 2 to 5 still match it still seems like a likely candidate. So calculate the confidence for each page. Maybe you ultimately need to get a better OCR
* Multiple pages could have the same identifier (not unique): So create a smarter algorithm. Maybe use the context of previously scanned pages as well this might help to narrow the selection of reasonable pages
* Your algorithm could be too slow: Well in that case find a way to get a less data-heavy identifier and optimize the matching

<li>Now parse the pdf of the book page by page and get the descriptor for every page to build up your database.</li>
<li>Now in your app: scan any page of the book by using an available OCR plugin for unity and extract the text on the page.</li>
<li>Apply your algorithm on this scanned text as well to get the unique identifier and compare it to your database.</li>
<li>If you are lucky you will know exactly which page you are looking at.</li>
<li>There are many ways this can easily get more difficult. but I believe one might find solutions for all of them:</li>
<li>Your scanning is not perfect: in that case, write a more robust comparison algorithm that will propose a list of the most likely pages. if there is no 100% match. Maybe the most important word is missing well if words 2 to 5 still match it still seems like a likely candidate. So calculate the confidence for each page. Maybe you ultimately need to get a better OCR</li>
<li>Multiple pages could have the same identifier (not unique): So create a smarter algorithm. Maybe use the context of previously scanned pages as well this might help to narrow the selection of reasonable pages</li>
<li>Your algorithm could be too slow: Well in that case find a way to get a less data-heavy identifier and optimize the matching</li>
</ul>

<p>I wish you good luck with this project!</p>

Stanssky,"Thank you all for the feedback! I've tried the AR Foundation plane detection demos,  surfed a little bit the web and understood it's quite quite bad. I don't know how it's used for anything tbh.

&#x200B;

I'm thinking of continuing my research around how TensorFlow could be used on a smartphone. Found an interesting tutorial which gave me hint that I could also use a public  large-scale object detection dataset, so I'm diving into the info here:

[https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/android/tutorials/object\_detection](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/android/tutorials/object_detection)

&#x200B;

This area of expertise is completely new to me but worst it can happen is to spend some of my free time gaining new knowledge on a quite trendy topic, so I'll give it a try!

Even the best OCR is unreliable in the most ideal situations. Fonts are often different which throws text and number translation waaaay off. Think page 8008 vs page boob.

Page numbers are not always in the same location. 

Finding an open book could be harder than expected. Training an AI to find that it is an opened book will be harder and have reliability issues. Why? What defines a book, is it pages inside an open book? Hand outs? An ebook? Loose leaf printouts in a binder?

Then figuring out which book, holy moly, it would need to have context of the content of each page. Then what if they are going from one book to the other?

After you figure out whether the concept works you could consider looking into specifics to generalize the tech. Book detection using a barcode scanner is simple enough.

Stanssky,"Thanks for the feedback from both of you. I understand this is a challenging task. I wasn't going to be interested if it was a trivial one. I'm a senior dev but in a completely different area.

I've made a demo which recognizes the cover of a book and replaces it with its back - this was just for PoC for image recognition and replacement. The tracking of the image is good enough. However this approach doesn't make much sense for what I am aiming for. I already know that most of the ""Books with AR"" solutions track QR codes or images however I want to design a solution which would work with \*any generic book (no QRs) so QR is not an option.

Book recognition is the easier of the three tasks and have some options, as you said - barcode combined with some other methods. I also believe the page number recognition could be done using OCR and improved by adding some constraints once I find how to detect the borders of the pages/book.

&#x200B;

Do you have experience using OpenCV or a similar library? I understand it's used for object detection, so on theory if I have thousands? photos of opened books I could train the ML to recognize an opened book Then I should figure a way to measure the angle at which the book is being placed against the camera and define the borders of the pages somehow? Is this the only possible and viable approach?

,Cause the type of tech you described and for it to be super comfortable while drinking and moving around dancing is two decades away. Yeah glasses will come out in the next 5-10 years but there is no way it will be able to replicate the sphere just yet. Way too much computing power needed. Also I think the type of rendering and screen used is different than the AR on your phone.

I can help you with this conversation if you’d like.

If you have a budget to work with, look at Niantic’s 8thWall web SDK. It’s a powerful and optimized web AR publishing solution that lets you work in A frame, Babylon.js, or three.js style.

Also, what kind of AR app are you trying to create? How complicated is your AR app? Can it be done without code using Worldcast and animated 3D model? Do you know how to work with and troubleshoot exported 3D files like .glb and .usdz? How will you deploy it to viewers? 

Let me know if these questions are useful or if you’d like to get on a quick call.

debayansince1994,"\- I have made a sample beach environment inspired by a tutorial.

\- I enjoyed making an environment for games (the first point), I am new to the AR/VR arena, and I tried following a tutorial that teaches you to make n AR/VR application but it included C#, so I started learning C# from scratch since I have no prior coding knowledge and I am enjoying what I am learning so far, the challenge is to retain that knowledge and make something on my own without the help of any tutorial to truly claim that I have learned it.

\- 4 to 8 hours a day, My learning path is divided into 4 parts. 2 hours of C#, 2 Hours of 3D sculpting on Blender (just started), 2 Hours of environmental art on Maya (Also just started and Lastly which I planned but not yet started which is GameDev on UE5. I don't know if I am doing it wrong.

\- As fast as possible. maybe 3-4 months to make an entry-level job to get started. But honestly, I think it's unrealistic to make the transition that fast.

\- I have my PC which is fairly powerful but cannot afford to make an upgrade right now but willing to do so in the future, and I have some good tutorials.

\- I used to work as a research associate earlier, but the job role was completely different, I used to make digital marketing materials. I mostly enjoyed work where art and design are involved, 10 Years back I used to dream of working on game cinematics, later I slowly developed an interest in 3D environment art and now AR/VR/XR/MR caught my eye. All the old interests are still there. I realised being a technical artist or having technical and coding knowledge along with artistic interest is a plus and sometimes desired.","<div class=""md""><p>- I have made a sample beach environment inspired by a tutorial.</p>

,"The VR version of Skyrim is pointless for this, especially since you portals are not stereoscopic (1 inverse sphere, not 2 for two eyes).

Unless it already exists, you'll need a custom mod for Skryim which pauses everything in the game, sets up the camera to have a specific FOV, then rotated the camera to right angles to render 6 views, needed for a skybox. Then, if your program does not support loading 6 skybox images, you'll need to load the skybox images into a cube in Blender, inverse the normals of the cube, place a camera inside of the cube and do an equirectangular render.

AfrikaXR,"Hello fellow Earthican. 
I hope I can help answer some of your questions regarding WorldCAST. I’ve been using their platform for about a year now for my own small AR startup here in South Africa, and I can confidently say that their platform is the most stable across both iOS and Android devices even over choppy mobile networks like we have here down in South Africa. Stability is crucial for me because many of the other platforms I tested claimed to offer X&Y and often times it just doesn’t work as advertised because they try and push the latest and greatest new features which can not be run on the majority of mobile devices because not everyone has the newest phones. I can’t sell an AR project to a client that might not work, then I look like a fool and charlatan. WorldCAST focuses on only a few features and it does them really really well, enough so that I feel confident in making a project for clients knowing that it’ll work on the majority of mobile devices therefore having a much wider audience reach. 
The 3D content/ sound etc sits on their own servers which are bare-metal IBM servers, meaning it is not a shared server, it is dedicated to them only, this helps with security and speed and helps lower the cost for small businesses. 
The reason why they are priced better than all the other platforms is because they have a INCLUSIVE vision of where they want AR to go in the future, they want to make it affordable to creators, many of whom are not particularly rolling in cash and have limited budgets. They are offering us small solo-creators the tools and chance at starting our own AR businesses that is usually only marketed to the monied upper crust of society thus making it exclusive to only those who can afford it. I’m my case our exchange rate is ZAR20-$1 and there was no way in hell I could afford a $250/month subscription with limited views which is what most other platforms price themselves at. 
The folks at WorldCAST are not greedy, they would rather see creators succeed against all odds because WebAR is the future and want to get as many people accustomed to it as they can without breaking bank. 
Look, I’ve worked on some big budget films in a previous life as an Art-Director and Concept Artist and I’ve been doing CGI for 20 odd years now and I can tell you straight up that WorldCAST is going to be the way forward, heck, I started using Blender at version 2.32 back in 2005 already and get a similar vibe between the 2 platforms overall contribution to the artists and creatives of the future. They are doing it for the creatives, not the capitalist, and their product just works rock solid. 

DM me if you want more info and don’t be shy to shout if you need help 🤘

I just really dig WorldCAST and am super passionate about promoting them because they gave me a chance to improve my situation in life where the other platform owners just skoffed at me because I live in Africa and wouldn’t even make the effort of listening to me.","<div class=""md""><p>Hello fellow Earthican.

Stability is crucial for me because many of the other platforms I tested claimed to offer X&amp;Y and often times it just doesn’t work as advertised because they try and push the latest and greatest new features which can not be run on the majority of mobile devices because not everyone has the newest phones. I can’t sell an AR project to a client that might not work, then I look like a fool and charlatan. WorldCAST focuses on only a few features and it does them really really well, enough so that I feel confident in making a project for clients knowing that it’ll work on the majority of mobile devices therefore having a much wider audience reach. 
The 3D content/ sound etc sits on their own servers which are bare-metal IBM servers, meaning it is not a shared server, it is dedicated to them only, this helps with security and speed and helps lower the cost for small businesses. 
The reason why they are priced better than all the other platforms is because they have a INCLUSIVE vision of where they want AR to go in the future, they want to make it affordable to creators, many of whom are not particularly rolling in cash and have limited budgets. They are offering us small solo-creators the tools and chance at starting our own AR businesses that is usually only marketed to the monied upper crust of society thus making it exclusive to only those who can afford it. I’m my case our exchange rate is ZAR20-$1 and there was no way in hell I could afford a $250/month subscription with limited views which is what most other platforms price themselves at. 
The folks at WorldCAST are not greedy, they would rather see creators succeed against all odds because WebAR is the future and want to get as many people accustomed to it as they can without breaking bank. 
Look, I’ve worked on some big budget films in a previous life as an Art-Director and Concept Artist and I’ve been doing CGI for 20 odd years now and I can tell you straight up that WorldCAST is going to be the way forward, heck, I started using Blender at version 2.32 back in 2005 already and get a similar vibe between the 2 platforms overall contribution to the artists and creatives of the future. They are doing it for the creatives, not the capitalist, and their product just works rock solid. </p>

<p>DM me if you want more info and don’t be shy to shout if you need help 🤘</p>

<p>I just really dig WorldCAST and am super passionate about promoting them because they gave me a chance to improve my situation in life where the other platform owners just skoffed at me because I live in Africa and wouldn’t even make the effort of listening to me.</p>

johnryan433,"Inmo just launched the Inmo Go exclusively in China, not to be mistaken with the Inmo Air 2, which is a lot bulkier. You can use a shipping proxy to get them or probably buy them on AliExpress for a markup. They are $250 USD or 1799 Chinese Yuan usually. They utilize green monochromatic waveguide lenses with 2000 nits of brightness, but they only have one waveguide lens’s which in my opinion is a huge drawback. It would be really cool if you bought two and melded them together. To make dual light weight glasses. I'd even pay you to make me a set if you figured it out; the battery life is 7 hours, so I’m assuming it would cut battery life in half, adding another waveguide lens. I am interested in doing this myself, but it would be a significant engineering challenge and sadly I’m not skilled enough. Modding the software should be fairly easy for me though. I think I can help with that and if I can’t I’d hire some who could.

You will import the zappar package for unity into unity using the Windows package manager.

LiDAR is a requirement for some reason. Despite Scaniverse etc doing this fine on non-pro devices.

Also, the face-ID camera works fine as a LiDAR for small objects and several scanning apps use that without issue.

After waiting hours for the stupid IOS17 upgrade just to be told ""nope. You don't have PRO!"" was quite annoying.","<div class=""md""><p>Don&#39;t bother if you don&#39;t have a &quot;PRO&quot; device.</p>

_echo3D,"Wow! That is a lot more polished and cleaner than most 3D scanning apps. Most 3D scanning apps have a problem with meshing and most of the 3D models come out smooth or blended but Apple's version comes out with more detail out-of-the-box.

But that's very true about people who are going to use Apple's Object Capture to create an app that they'll charge people to use when it's free. Definitely avoid those apps or just create your own.

We're thinking about creating a free app with Apple's Object Capture so that anyone can upload their 3D models directly to our cloud-based 3D DAM. That way you can easily use them with an app or game with our SDKs. I believe right now, the 3D models are saved on your storage device and then you have to export it to a computer and then import it to your app or game engine. That's too many steps involved that can be easily reduced.

I know a lot of smaller e-Commerce sites are definitely going to take advantage of an Object Capture app to showcase their products in 3D and AR.","<div class=""md""><p>Wow!

c_Gah,"I just got my kickstarter pair. I'm surprised there is such little talk about it, like nothing. I've had the INMO Air 1 and NREAL (now XREAL) Air and honestly the INMO Air 2's are the best experience on the market (for what they can do)

The INMO Air 2 is a full color, binocular, waveguide lens, standalone system glasses. In this market they are the first and only one of its kind and they actually work. Even better is that INMO released thier SDK so as a developer I can create whatever app I want for the glasses and use it. It's pretty impressive.

Positives to note when comparing them to the XREAL is that a bird bath optics system sits where your eyebrows are so a lot of your upper frontal vision is block, waveguide doesn't have that issue, also not being tethered to your phone increases usability 10x in my opinion.

The biggest caveat is that the screen size is small at 26 FOV, and I don't think this limit will be exceeded in the short term, the cost, battery power and heat just increase too much for tech and market at this time. This kinda makes it fall out of the ""monitor replacement"" category, which is what 95% of smart glass owners want to use them for. However, I can load up the youtube app and put on subtitles and have no issues. It's a perfect accessory for watching a movie on a plane flight.

That being said if you want a monitor replacement, or bigger screen size and don't mind being tethered to a phone the I would consider looking at the XREAL Air or Rokid Max.

I've also saved the biggest positive for last. The INMO Air 2 is the first screen glasses that my wife said she could see me wearing while outside and not immediately know something was up with them, they looked pretty normal.","<div class=""md""><p>I just got my kickstarter pair.

Automatic-FJG81,"I do. Here’s my take on them. The product had generated considerable hype, which piqued my interest. However, after a few weeks of usage, my experience has been somewhat mixed.

Design and Comfort

The fit of the glasses may not be an issue for everyone, but they don't sit well on my face. They perch too high on my nose, obscuring the bottom portion of the screen when viewing. Unfortunately, the glasses are not adjustable.

Performance and Features

The Inmo Air 2 glasses boast numerous innovative features. However, in my experience, these features have been inconsistent. The wireless capability of the glasses is impressive, but I've encountered the following issues:

The glasses cannot connect to Bluetooth headphones.

The phone mirroring feature is unreliable, functioning less than half the time.

The range of available applications is limited, and the quality of those that are available is subpar.

Other Observations

The screen size is smaller compared to the xReal Air 2 glasses. This could be tolerable if the screen resolution was superior.

Final Thoughts

In conclusion, the Inmo Air 2 glasses feel like a product still in the development stage. They have potential, but the execution is lacking. The unstable connection and short battery life make them a less than ideal choice for everyday use.

I hope that future iterations of the product will address these issues. Until then, I would argue that the Inmo Air 2 glasses are underdeveloped and require further refinement before they can truly deliver on their promises. It's also worth noting that customer service has been unresponsive.","<div class=""md""><p>I do. Here’s my take on them. The product had generated considerable hype, which piqued my interest.

I have been stalking these on youtube and i have the same impression that even though they are rough around the edges there seems to be barely much talk around them.

They have the biggest advantage i wish x/nreal do not have and that is being wireless. I wish nreal would drop some of the fluff and go all in on making their glasses wireless. The inmos also can have a none shades version and still look “normal”.

I also feel the inmos could be smaller and lighter if they drop the cameras or at least make a version without the cameras on the front and bump up battery abit.

Sankin2004,"Thank you for that. I recently put in an order through the Inmo website. I loose out on the super early bird discount, but I still got the early bird one with the free ring. The facts that it is cordless and stand-alone are both what are driving me. I mean a wearable screen maybe sounds cool, but if I have to be wired in it kind of defeats the purpose, ie I could just look at the screen of my device. 

Ideally I definitely see me using these out in public, mostly at work. Listening to my YouTube music while at labor, and maybe asking chat gpt for help when I’m stuck on a coding problem. The live translation has also peaked my interest for travel. 

Some cons I am aware of, the smallish screen size, the over loud speaker(though that can be fixed I think pairing a wireless earnuds), and a fairly short battery life with heavy use. Also I was made aware that the availability of apps was limited, lack of a web browser, and lack of google play availability. As a personal con I’m also gonna end up spending more monthly on my phone for upgraded data settings. (Hot spot data costs me more). 

That said, you’ve given me some small hope because as a beginning developer myself, I might be able to still install, or make the apps that I need. Have you developed anything for it yet? Another important question is can they be used while charging? I have a very large power storage so if they can I don’t have to worry about battery life. I have other questions, but I’ll stop with these two for now.","<div class=""md""><p>Thank you for that. I recently put in an order through the Inmo website.

Do you already have a website for your restaurant? Then you can host the menu page there and generate a QR code easily that will just take people to that page. Here's how to generate a code.

,"I don't understand for whom are projects like Monado even developing their tools for?

There's no single HDK+SDK one can use  to develop PCVR hardware with.

Need positional tracking for your hardware? Grab a ~~Valve HDK~~ ~~Tundra Labs HDK~~ oh wait it's been out of stock forever. Make your own by getting a chipset and building your own HDK for 10K+ USD. What's that, can't afford it? Though luck.

Want SLAM tracking? Spend another 10K+ to make a custom 4 camera board with a 4channel MIPI input to USB3 output chip on it and one which can control the exposure time of each camera. Oh did you want a ready HDK for that? Though luck. Then go ahead and take a rough open source library like Orb-SLAM and spend hundreds of hours coding a real library around it for VR. Don't have the experience or time? Eat shit.

Want a HDK for controllers with LED or Lighthouse tracking? Eat shit.

Hardware devs are forced to go with Qualcomm chipsets and reference designs even when they are 100% interested in the PC platform. How much incentive do they have to not just stick with Android if they have to go that far?

Then we wonder why there's not many firms ""interested"" in PCVR, when the wall they have to climb is now 90 degrees steep.

Again, the tools Collabora is developing is very cool, but without any HDK around you're just going to have tinkerers tinkering with their old Valve Indexes.","<div class=""md""><p>I don&#39;t understand for whom are projects like Monado even developing their tools for? Pretty much only well funded companies who don&#39;t care about Linux/libre can build hardware to take advantage of their software, otherwise it&#39;s just people playing with Valve Index in OpenXR.  It&#39;s such a wasted potential with no associated HDK project.</p>

\- Both for Android and iOS, No LiDAR is required.  
\- See your model in Augmented Reality.  
\- You can export in glb, usdz, fbx, obj and stl with more formats going to be added on future.  
\- Embed the scan to your website to showcase your product in AR and 3D.  
\- Measure your scan, for example, your room, furniture etc.  
\- You can edit your scan, crop it and rotate it.  
\- Nerf is going to be integrated in the future.

I'm wondering how smooth the textures will be and if their processing engine will smooth these 3D models out in the backend.

The only thing about creating all these 3D models on your iPhone is that they will take up a lot of storage space. The best solution for this is to store them in the cloud to reduce storage space. Since it's a native iOS app most likely we're going to be looking at USDZ file formats.

alchemist1e9,"How’s the Maverick dev kit working out for you? 

It seems the viable dev options are Everysight Maverick, Vuzix, and ActiveLook. The developer glasses from Everysight and ActiveLook don’t have cameras, Vuzix has the Blade 2 which is a full independent Android device and which has a front camera vs the Z100 which doesn’t and is a BLE device like the Maverick and ActiveLooks. 

I feel BLE displays are a good idea and more likely to catch on as they can be very lightweight and paired to everyone’s existing smartphones for apps. I’ve ordered the ActiveLook Enterprise, which is cheapest by far, and actually very very developer friendly, even providing their low level BLE protocol and open API/SDKs without any licensing requirements, they are also the lightest by far, but the screen is only 304 x 256 16 shades grayscale. 

https://github.com/ActiveLook/Activelook-API-Documentation

The lack of front cameras sent me down the path of looking for small BLE cameras, which apparently don’t exist, however that has had me discover what I believe is the current most viable ultra small developer friendly mini camera approach that could potentially clip onto standard glasses frames, run off battery, and wirelessly send images (maybe 2-3 frames/sec) over BLE to a phone. That appears to be a XAIO Esp32 s3 camera. 

As a developer I feel a modular approach of lightweight HUD glasses, front camera, and audio, perhaps all being BLE is a more practical way forward.   A mix and match approach would allow varied solutions for different preferences and situations. 

I’d be very interested to hear your opinion of the Mavericks for development and they do seem to be the most interesting device out there for lightweight high quality HUD style display, and if somehow camera and audio can be done as add ons. Everysight is coming from US Defense industry and built the HUD systems in US fighter jets and other military equipment.

alchemist1e9,"I see an Everysight Translate app on both Google Play and Apple App store also. Have you tried that one? 

Oddly Apple doesn’t have the My Glasses one but Android seems to. 

Feels like there might be an opportunity to publish a neat app for them. 

Even without speakers the mic is useful if that works. 

I was thinking if an app could use a combination of independent and relatively cheap components to cover HUD glasses, microphone, audio out, and forward POV camera and integrate that into something it might be popular. 

I wish there was a camera solution a bit like this but Bluetooth Low Energy and smaller. Or perhaps clips to glasses, however the back head mount might be more robust. 

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPX4VVMM

The experience I’m envisioning is a user slaps together their own collection of devices and the app pulls all the parts together in to something useful, exactly what that is I don’t want to disclose as I think I have a unique idea.","<div class=""md""><p>I see an Everysight Translate app on both Google Play and Apple App store also.

alchemist1e9,"So I got them working using a Samsung Galaxy A32 phone running a very recent Android. These are actually really neat, extremely promising for some app development. Definitely different league than the ActiveLook enzos. 

Their software is pretty rough on the edges and clear more demo based. The head tracking where you look up or down get different panels/dashboards and turn side to side to move the cursor/selection is pretty intuitive.

The My Glasses has the hook to ChatGPT which I setup and is neat but … well needs improvement to be more than a trick, it can’t keep a conversation going or anything. I also tested the live translation app, and it works but does have trouble keeping up, they might be trying to do on device live translation which is a bit hard to do quickly give phone processor capabilities. I find foreign language videos on Youtube and play them with it listening and it does actually seem to approximately work for the languages I can partially understand. 

Definitely my favorite device I’ve acquired so far. Will be interesting to compare to Vuzix Z100s that are available now also and similar BLE based with similar specs.

Thanks for kick starting your journey on AR segment , you have started A-frame which is best for WebAR and it will boost your confidence as well.

you can start developing core AR skills as below.

you need to understand the basics of AR technology. What is AR? How does it work? What are the different types of AR? Once you understand the basics, you can start learning the more specific skills you need to develop AR apps. can check below free course

[https://www.coursera.org/lecture/ar/google-ar-QD56M](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/ar/google-ar-QD56M)

Next AR development is a programming-intensive field. You will need to know how to code in order to develop AR apps. The most popular programming language for AR development is Unity.

Next steps you need to learn an AR development platform. An AR development platform is a software development kit (SDK) that provides the tools and APIs you need to develop AR apps. The most popular AR development platforms are Unity, Vuforia, ARKit, and ARCore.check below youtube course

wpniewgoyu,"Lol maybe this a troll, but this just isn’t fair for a couple of reasons. Meta (Facebook at the time) bought Oculus nearly a decade ago. SIX years later in 2020 they produced a hardware device that has been the most successful VR headset with consumers by far, and even on pace with gaming consoles, — the Oculus/Meta Quest 2. They aren’t hoping to do that, they’ve already done it and will likely repeat this with Meta Quest 3 soon. They also have the Meta Quest Pro which is the state-of-the-art standalone headset (as far as what has been released). Also, keep in mind that when a company acquires another —- it’s not like the acquired company’s workers are all let go lol. For the most part at least, a lot of those same engineers continue working on their same product - just as employees of the new parent company instead. So regardless it’s not really logical to say we don’t know if Meta can make good hardware because they bought Oculus, when former Oculus employees just became Meta employees. Anyways I’m mega excited for Vision Pro and likely will prefer it to Meta devices. But it’s crazy to me how many people discredit Meta and pretend as if they’re incompetent, just because they don’t like the company or Zuckerberg. Meta is the current market leader in XR devices and will remain that at least until Apple has a smaller and cheaper form factor. I appreciate that Meta has “thrown a lot of money” at this, actually took the risk to build things, figured out a bunch of technical challenges (and often open source those solutions), and proved adoption could be widespread —- making all of this relevant enough for other companies to finally consider getting involved in the market.","<div class=""md""><p>Lol maybe this a troll, but this just isn’t fair for a couple of reasons.

Zuck has repeatedly shown he has vision for the VR space, and sees it as the future for his company. So much so, that he has been pouring billions of dollars every quarter into its development. 

This course of action actually goes against the mainstream opinion, and has been the largest contributor to META's drop in share price.

Markosappsandgames,"I worked as an AR engineer and led a team for 2 years.

We developed multiple projects hor high profile companies / institutions and a platform for most of the relevant hardware like Quest, HoloLens, MagicLeap, Mobile, NReal...

Unity is the best tool atm since it is the first one to support new sdks, has most of the native features, supports all relevant hardver, is easy to use with lots of docs and tutorials, its versatile and cross platform, etc...
I actually wish there was a better tool since Unity is actually spaghetti code inside 🍝

WebXR is a cool idea, but it is very limited atm, not that good performance, not so great tooling, no native features, lacks sdks...

For me personally, the AR / XR seems to be in a constant prototype phase for now and near future. A lot of hype and looks cool, but not a lot of actually usefull real world use cases anyone would use more than once let alone pay for.

Some companies are willing to throw cash so that they can say they are doing something cool in AR, Metaverse etc. But from an engineering perspective this means rushed / barely working apps without solid engineering foundations because why would they when there will be like 20 users total.

I ended up switching to backend which I find more challenging and more engineering focused when working at scale.

Again, this last part is personal experience. Someone working at high profile XR companies may have different experience, or people might enjoy creating shorter experiences.","<div class=""md""><p>I worked as an AR engineer and led a team for 2 years.</p>

So its interesting for to hear there is already some potential issues to watch out for when you say optimization, but its also an interesting discussion angle for a thesis.

Im surprised to hear Unity is the easiest way to develop AR app, as i have no experience with it other than some poor tinkering way too many years ago. May i ask, easiest in which way? Meaning, the most low-code solution? I enjoy writing code and im quite proficient at it in many languages, but of course the ease of use, documentation, community support, license, platform dependencies and extensibility of frameworks is always a huge factor.","<div class=""md""><p>Hey, thanks for your reply!

I took a photo of her art, masked and animated different layers and exported each layer with a green background so I could pull a chroma key and get my alphas, then I just layered them in 2.5D to get depth and parallax. 
I even added an Easter egg with a second QR code that is only visible once the initial QR was scanned, a bit like the movie ‘Inception’, dream within a dream, AR within AR 🤣

Since this is a one-off event and my first foray into AR we are likely going with 8th Wall.

Mostly just an image target with separate video layers of my animations w/ alpha.  
Maybe one layer as a texture on a mesh at most. Not sure about that yet either.  


But I'm hoping I can start from one of their projects and bug the devs in slack if I run into issues.

Shubhra22,"For WebAR there are currently not enough open source projects. Try AR.js, MindAR for WebAR on browsers. You can also try WebXR, but it does not have support for IPhone. My favourite is Needle engine with Unity. You can easily create AR applications in Unity and port them to three.js using needle. It supports exporting as AR.js as well. You can add Mediapipe for ML also. 

For paid solution we have 8th wall, Banuba and zap works…. Many more, but these theee are my favourite. 

I am planning to add some WebAR tutorials on my YouTube channel. Feel free to subscribe

RealitiQXR,"If you want a research project for your learning then focus on WebAR segment with taking integration of AI, this will boost your technical as well as design abilities.

here are some hot topics and areas where a research project is needed in AR:

**Real-time object tracking and occlusion:** This is a key challenge in AR, as it allows AR objects to be placed accurately in the real world and to interact with real objects. There is still a lot of room for improvement in this area, especially in terms of tracking objects in complex environments and with occlusion.

**Haptic feedback:-** Haptic feedback is the sense of touch, and it is essential for creating immersive AR experiences. However, it is still a challenging problem to provide realistic haptic feedback in AR, especially for large objects or objects that are not physically present.

**Natural language interaction:-** Natural language interaction allows users to interact with AR systems using their voice.

<p>here are some hot topics and areas where a research project is needed in AR:</p>

<p><strong>Real-time object tracking and occlusion:</strong> This is a key challenge in AR, as it allows AR objects to be placed accurately in the real world and to interact with real objects. There is still a lot of room for improvement in this area, especially in terms of tracking objects in complex environments and with occlusion.</p>

<p><strong>Haptic feedback:-</strong> Haptic feedback is the sense of touch, and it is essential for creating immersive AR experiences. However, it is still a challenging problem to provide realistic haptic feedback in AR, especially for large objects or objects that are not physically present.</p>

<p><strong>Natural language interaction:-</strong> Natural language interaction allows users to interact with AR systems using their voice. This is a promising area of research, as it has the potential to make AR more accessible to a wider range of users. However, there are still challenges to overcome, such as understanding natural language in real time and generating realistic AR content.</p>

No, AR glasses do not only work if you have good vision. In fact, many AR glasses come with prescription lenses inserts that you can order from the manufacturer or an optometrist. This allows you to see the augmented reality content clearly, without having to wear your regular glasses or contacts.

But what is the utility of a low-res virtual monitor ? It offers you almost the same resolution as you laptop … better work on the laptop then

<p>With AR glasses … no. the best of the best on the market is 1080p per eye, and this is great for watching movies or playing videogames, but for computer use, it’s not enought … unless you work in low res, like 1080p max max max.</p>

<p>But what is the utility of a low-res virtual monitor ? It offers you almost the same resolution as you laptop … better work on the laptop then</p>

<p>When AR glasses will allow 80-90° or more FoV, and 4K per eye, then you will be able to have a real high-res, high size monitor that is not cutted when your head moves, and then we will talk</p>

Additionally, **Micro OLED** displays are also being developed for AR/VR glasses, and they offer even higher resolution and brightness than miniLED displays.

Necessary_Court_4529,"eye strain is a personal thing that really happens on a case by case basis. i regularly spend 14+ hours a day looking at screens with no eye strain whatsoever. 

with that being said, consumer AR glasses project a screen at approximately the focal distance of a cinema. the distance of the screen to your face won’t be an issue in terms of eye strain UNLESS you don’t have good eyes, in which case you would be straining to see as if you weren’t wearing your glasses at the movies.

what many find so straining about AR and VR is reacting to and compensating for small movements, which gives them motion sickness. again, everybody’s brain is different, if you have “VR legs” already this won’t be an issue for you. if you don’t and purchase something like an xreal and you’re in mirroring mode, you’ll notice that the screen is static in the displays, but responds to small shakes of your head that slightly jostles the display in your vision. this shakiness is also what makes gyro-based 3dof feel slightly off, though the lower fov actually lessens these issues compared to early VR implementations like google glass. 

as with many things, the best idea is just to try it yourself. amazon offers free returns for 30 days with prime, and the xreal air and rokid max are both available from them. i bit the bullet on xreal airs recently and fwiw they are incredible.","<div class=""md""><p>eye strain is a personal thing that really happens on a case by case basis. i regularly spend 14+ hours a day looking at screens with no eye strain whatsoever. </p>

RealitiQXR,"Sorry to hear your issues.

There are a few possible workarounds for this issue. One option is to use a different AR platform that supports ground plane detection on more devices. Some other popular AR platforms such  include ARCore and ARKit.

Another option is to use a different method of detecting planes in your AR application. There are a number of different algorithms that can be used for plane detection, and some of them are more robust than others. You may be able to find an algorithm that works on your Honor X8, even if it doesn't support ground plane detection.

Finally, you could also try to work around the issue by using a different type of AR experience. For example, you could create an AR application that doesn't require ground plane detection, such as an AR game that takes place in the air or in space.

Here are some  APIs that you might want to consider:

ARCore: This is a Google-developed AR platform that is supported on a wide range of Android and iOS devices.

ARKit: This is an Apple-developed AR platform that is supported on all recent iOS devices.

Unity MARS: This is an AR platform that is built on top of Unity. It supports a wide range of devices and features, including ground plane detection.

In terms of price, the Nimo Planet Glasses Air are the most affordable option. However, the Lenovo ThinkReality A3 and Magic Leap One offer more features and a better overall experience. If you are looking for the most realistic smart glasses product that can replace your computer monitors today, the Lenovo ThinkReality A3 is a good option. However, if you are willing to wait a few months for the technology to improve, the Magic Leap One is the best choice.

reggedtrex,"* Buy Google Glass on eBay and try. IIRC it's 600x400, FOV 15, which translates into a tiny box of low res image.
* Then, I'm sure you've played with some version of Oculus, that's FOV 90 and 1800x1900 per eye. It has goof FOV, but resolution is still shit.
* Macbook Pro 16, at a distance comfortable for typing, is roughly FOV 50, and it has its own snowflake resolution, but let's say it's 2k, similar to the whole Oculus 2.
* [here's a handy guide for FOV](https://c.tadst.com/gfx/1200x675/measuring-sky-with-hand.png)

Now interpolate/extrapolate and decide what you need.

Looking at https://www.vr-compare.com/headset/tclrayneox2 , it says FOV 25, and no mention of resolution (but I don't think it's anywhere close  to 4K when extrapolated to FOV 90)

YMMV, personally I already struggle when using VS Code on a standard iPad, for anything smaller I can only tolerate Vim, and start feeling comfortable starting at roughly 14"", but strongly prefer 16"" and up, two or three screens.

Apple's Vision Pro will deliver the environment with good enough resolution and FOV, so I can see how I could use it on trans-oceanic flights (yet it's heavy), but despite having been on a lookout for years, now I don't see anybody getting ahead of Apple, frankly. Maybe in 2025 or smth, and maybe even Apple themselves will deliver a cheaper lighter version.","<div class=""md""><ul>

RealitiQXR,"Our answer will be yes , but its really need some in depth efforts,  There are several types of augmented reality that do not rely on visuals as below.

1- Audio Augmented Reality (AAR): This form of AR incorporates sound to superimpose digital information onto the physical world. For instance, an AAR application might play specific sounds when you approach certain locations, or it could offer audio instructions for a given task. 

2- Haptic Augmented Reality (HAR): This type of AR uses haptic feedback to overlay digital information onto the real world. For example, a HAR app might deliver gentle vibrations to your device when you approach particular locations, or it could provide haptic cues for specific tasks. 

3- Scent Augmented Reality (SAR): This type of AR utilizes scents to overlay digital information onto the real world. For instance, a SAR app might emit a particular fragrance when you approach certain locations, or it could provide scent-based cues to enhance your experience during a task.

Both of these have limitations and to our knowledge, there is no universal solution. Sometimes you would have to develop something specific to your use case. For some of our games, we needed to develop an object detector for fast-moving textureless RC cars, and we use it in our work. So, it is a trial-and-error to see what fits your needs best.

You can setup up to 3 monitors screens, cover the glasses if there is too much sun outside for a more immersive experience, and they are ""socially acceptable"" (meaning you do not look weird in public haha). Screens are quite stable, and they are about 2meters from you, which is pretty comfortable for the eyes.

Now THAT is the real usecase for VisionOS. No need to worry about bulky batteries and heavy cameras and screens and such. They only add a few pounds to the 2000 lb. car, and the battery life would be in terms of miles not hours, with one or more backups for the windshield display available as well.

Edit: And that rollable screen described in another patent might be perfect for use here.

&#x200B;

1-Is there an app I can use to turn pictures into AR?

there are a number of apps that can be used to turn pictures into AR. Some popular options include 

mywebar,  Aurasma ,  LARP etc.

&#x200B;

2- How can I turn products into AR?

There are a few different ways to turn products into AR. One way is to use a 3D scanner to create a 3D model of the product. Another way is to use a photogrammetry software to create a 3D model from a series of photos.

Once you have a 3D model of your product, you can then use an AR app to create an AR experience.

&#x200B;

 

3-How complicated will it be to do so?

&#x200B;

The complexity of turning products into AR will depend on the method you choose. Using a 3D scanner is the most straightforward method, but it can be expensive to purchase a 3D scanner. Using photogrammetry software is a more affordable option, but it can be more time-consuming to create a 3D model from a series of photos. 

&#x200B;

 

4-Will I have to make the 3D models myself?

You can make the 3D models yourself, or you can hire a company to create the models for you. If you choose to create the models yourself, you will need to have some experience with 3D modeling softwares like blender or unity or maya etc.

&#x200B;

 

5-How can I integrate these AR versions into my website (like Apple for example)

&#x200B;

There are a number of ways to integrate AR versions of your products into your website. One way is to use a web-based AR platform, such as **8th Wall** or **Vuforia**. These platforms allow you to create AR experiences that can be embedded in your website.

**How to Create Occlusion Masks and Materials for AR**

Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that allows users to interact with virtual objects in the real world. One of the key challenges in AR is occlusion, which is the ability to hide virtual objects behind real-world objects.

There are a few different ways to achieve occlusion effects in AR. One common approach is to use ARKit (for iOS) or ARCore (for Android) with custom shaders and materials.

**Using ARKit or ARCore**

ARKit and ARCore are frameworks that provide access to depth and scene information. This information can be used to create occlusion masks, which are black-and-white images that indicate which parts of a virtual object are hidden behind real-world objects.

**Creating Custom Shaders and Materials**

Custom shaders and materials are used to control how objects are rendered in the AR scene. By using custom shaders, you can specify how occlusion masks are applied to virtual objects.

**Generating Occlusion Masks**

There are a few different ways to generate occlusion masks. One common approach is to use depth maps. Depth maps are images that represent the distance of each pixel in the scene from the camera. By using depth maps, you can create occlusion masks that accurately reflect the relative depth of objects in the scene.

Another approach to generating occlusion masks is to use computer vision techniques. Computer vision algorithms can be used to identify and create occlusion masks based on real-world objects.

**Applying Occlusion Materials**

Once you have generated occlusion masks, you can apply them to virtual objects using custom shaders and materials. The occlusion materials should determine how objects interact with the real-world environment, ensuring proper occlusion of virtual objects behind real-world objects.

**Testing and Refinement**

Once you have implemented occlusion effects in your AR app, it is important to test them in different environments and lighting conditions. This will help you to ensure that the occlusion effects work as expected. You may also need to refine your shaders and materials as needed for optimal performance and visual quality.

<p><strong>How to Create Occlusion Masks and Materials for AR</strong></p>

<p>Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that allows users to interact with virtual objects in the real world. One of the key challenges in AR is occlusion, which is the ability to hide virtual objects behind real-world objects.</p>

<p>There are a few different ways to achieve occlusion effects in AR. One common approach is to use ARKit (for iOS) or ARCore (for Android) with custom shaders and materials.</p>

I am not a programmer myself.

I have good experience with unity and ARFoundation.

Unity and ARFoundation are free to use (for Starters) and you will find a lot of tutorials on youtube about it.

It maybe depends on what kind of app you want to develop, but for me unity and ARFoundation was a good choice.

Answering your question more in depth:   
In my opinion the right answer to these kind of questions is another question: What do you want to build?  


From experience I can tell that the most successful apps/experiences were built by people who were excited to build them (this is key). If you're just learning a topic for the sake of learning and/or because you want to do it without a concrete goal in mind then the path will be very tedious and difficult (programming is not always fun).   


Your best bet is to try different AR experiences and choose one that you want to replicate. Once you've found one research how it is built (i.e did they use Unity?, is it deployed on mobile? VR? smart glasses?, etc). That will tell you the kind of things you will need to learn.   


That said, chances are you'll be able to build most experiences out there with Unity hence my answer.

RealitiQXR," As per the WorldCAST AR documentation, you have the option to host the application on your own server. However, to achieve this, several specific requirements must be fulfilled:

Firstly, your server needs to be running a web server that supports PHP 7.2 or a later version. Additionally, the server should have the essential PHP extensions installed, including curl, json, and gd.

Another crucial prerequisite is possessing a valid WorldCAST AR license. Only with the proper licensing can you proceed to set up and configure the software on your server, as per the comprehensive guidelines laid out in the WorldCAST AR documentation. By adhering to these conditions, you can successfully deploy and utilize WorldCAST AR on your client's server, ensuring complete control and data privacy for their users.

RealitiQXR,"Many use cases coming to mainstream now a days with Augmented Reality check out below for more insights.

&#x200B;

AR can be used to create interactive learning experiences that make it easier for students to understand complex concepts. For example, AR can be used to overlay 3D models of molecules on top of textbooks, or to create virtual field trips to historical sites. 

&#x200B;

AR can be used to help customers visualize products in their homes or businesses before they buy them. For example, AR can be used to overlay furniture on top of a living room floor, or to show how a piece of clothing would look on a person. 

&#x200B;

AR can be used to provide medical students with hands-on training, or to help doctors diagnose and treat patients. For example, AR can be used to overlay 3D models of organs on top of patients' bodies, or to provide real-time feedback on surgical procedures. 

&#x200B;

AR can be used to provide turn-by-turn directions, or to overlay maps and other information on top of the real world. For example, AR can be used to help people find their way around a new city, or to get directions to a specific location.

AR has the capacity to give analog back to what would otherwise be a digital only internet. Think about geolocation of a graphical overlay onto the exterior surface of physical places. Imagine if a URL like www mysite dot com was associated to a physical place.

The power doing this has, is by making physical location relevant to web browsers. Far flung away businesses could target business audiences in geographically specific places and give meaning to customers physically instead of just visually online. 

And it could be a wide spanning as to the extent we have web addresses like .com, .ca, .xyz and etc. You could switch channels and experience a totally different physical overlay, visually, on a physical space. This by itself has massive value to businesses looking for niche audiences but who are unable to afford physical storefront. It could kick off a brand new race for ownership of digital property having real world meaning to real people.

1 - Multiple high definition monitors/TV screen anywhere anytime

2 - Easy heads-up street navigation

3 - real life translation of text and possibly speech

4 - Digital tourism overlays in historical areas, buildings, museums and the like

5 - Augmented shopping across the board such as being able to see whether a particular item has an allergen or ingredient you don’t like just by looking at it on a shelf, or a live budget calculator in a HUD

5.5 - Hands free instructions for furniture, PC building, or anything else really like cooking

6 - hands free communication much like wireless headphones allow us today but now with visual elements (FaceTime, seeing graphs or charts live, see who’s calling you without having to lift your phone or watch etc)

And the list can easily go on imo.

This all assumes high tech, compact AR headsets are possible in the future.

<p>2 - Easy heads-up street navigation</p>

<p>3 - real life translation of text and possibly speech</p>

<p>4 - Digital tourism overlays in historical areas, buildings, museums and the like</p>

<p>5 - Augmented shopping across the board such as being able to see whether a particular item has an allergen or ingredient you don’t like just by looking at it on a shelf, or a live budget calculator in a HUD</p>

<p>5.5 - Hands free instructions for furniture, PC building, or anything else really like cooking</p>

<p>6 - hands free communication much like wireless headphones allow us today but now with visual elements (FaceTime, seeing graphs or charts live, see who’s calling you without having to lift your phone or watch etc)</p>

<p>And the list can easily go on imo.</p>

<p>This all assumes high tech, compact AR headsets are possible in the future.</p>

WhereTheLightIsNot,"If you do make a long detailed post, please let us know where. I’m very curious to see your thoughts on this. 

The first hurdle that comes to mind is a study where they measured the effects of mirrors on dancer’s technical skills. So they looked at dancers who often practiced in front of a mirror vs those that did not. 

Those that practiced in front of a mirror suffered technically once the mirror was removed and became worse dancers compared to their non-mirror practicing counterparts. 

The conclusion that was made was that those dancers became dependent on the visual cues they saw in the mirror. Rather than 100% of their focus being on the way their body’s feel in the moment, their attention was split between how they felt and how they looked. Once you removed the visual aspect, they couldn’t perform as well. 

I think this is highly important when it comes to AR/VR training. It would be easy to replicate some of the same mistakes as found in the study if the learned behavior or skill was too closely tired to the training process itself. 

To me this is easy to work around as long as you’re aware of it. You would just need a consistent unguided practice mode where the program still measures your technical ability while performing but you find out after, make adjustments with that feedback, and then try again.","<div class=""md""><p>If you do make a long detailed post, please let us know where.

**About the study** (as you've described it):  
I'd be skeptical about any negative conclusions about the mirror-dependent dancers unless the study shows some way in which their dancing technique suffered to begin with.  Were these all WORSE dancers than the non-mirror dancers?  Because if they all had the same talent, then it would seem that both groups simply had different learning methods, neither better or worse(?)  Maybe if you forced the non-mirrored dancers to use mirrors, that would screw THEM up, too.

**To relate to AR:**  
So, perhaps an AR teaching system needs to be extremely customizable to the user/dancer, adapting to how they learn best.  As an ADHDer my mind organizes incredibly differently from others, requiring different tools.  Maybe some ADHD dancer would *constantly* benefit in practice by their AR darkening ""distraction areas"" of the room, and spot-lighting ""focus"" areas to dance in.","<div class=""md""><p>Thanks for sharing! </p>

WhereTheLightIsNot,"[Here](https://iadms.org/media/5781/iadms-resource-paper-mirrors-in-the-dance-class.pdf) is a paper that references several different studies and resources on this. To summarize a little bit more succinctly: Physical movement training is heavily based on an internal proprioceptive experience. If you are taught to practice a physical skill in a way that relies too heavily on external stimulations, (such as your reflection in a mirror) when that external stimulation is removed, performance of that skill suffers. 

I think what I am referring to has less to do with learning methods (although that is absolutely crucial to this topic in other ways like you've mentioned) and has more to do with how the brain forms connections and neural pathways. 

I'm really bringing this up because I think it would be very easy to overdo the external stimulation in an AR setting.  If the student's brain associates the physical movement practice too closely with the visual or auditory cues in AR instead of the internal proprioceptive or kinesthetic feeling of the physical movement, when those are removed (anywhere outside of AR training) there may be a mismatch between the student's ability to perform technically during training vs outside of training. 

All that being said, this is more of a tangent from your original post than anything else haha. I'm fascinated by this use case in AR and believe in it strongly. There are so many areas of thought surrounding this that we haven't touched on. 

As a fellow ADHDer myself, I've somewhat recently shifted my focus toward working on organizational tools designed specifically for AR to help with how my brain works so it's funny you bring that up.

Nreal air was 1080p and had too many comfort and visibility issues for me, and for less price i was able to get a 43 inch 4k tv that is immensely better for work and splitting my screen with powertoys/fancyzones. And that's without an umbillical cord tugging on my ear or weighty optics on my nose bridge. Wireless solutions are even lower resolution.

I would say hold off on AR until wireless/waveguide options start to scale.

edit: the windows 3dof beta \*helped\* but you can only do so much with scaling. I also have pretty bad eyes and had to use a lens insert which made things more uncomfortable though. YMMV","<div class=""md""><p>In my experience the current AR glasses field is too compromised for the price, especially for professional stuff.

RealitiQXR,"First of all thanks for your effort to design an ar app.

coming to your question no-1 

tech stack you can choose any frontend part you can design flutter or react and for ar segment you can go ahead with  **Unity + ARKit/ARCore** 

question no -2 

Yes many sdk and libraries available , frequently used ones are  **ARToolKit Real-Size Tracking** ,  **AR.js** ,  **Unity ColorPicker** with some Apple sdk also will help after a bit code changes.

&#x200B;

Now question- 3 

No as of now to be honest not any tutorial or youtube videos can help much , yes basics you can get as below link .

I was wondering if you've tried it on Apple WebKit and how the performance compares to Chrome?

Also when you mention it currently supports a single image, does it mean it can only track one image at a time? Or do you mean it can only detect one image at each frame? I was wondering if I could provide 20 images to it to detect as long as I want one image to be tracked?

Ideally I wanna see if I can integrate it in an Ionic Capacitor app.

RealitiQXR,"Hello You can follow below to start developing your idea into reality.

Choose a development platform like Unity or Vuforia that suits your needs for AR app development. Gather data about your office building's layout, seat locations, and occupant names. Use floor plans or mapping services for this. 

Create 3D models of the office building and seats using software like Blender or Maya. 

Add tracking data to the 3D models to enable AR tracking, using markers or the device's camera through opensource sdk/libraries or can create packages also. Design a user-friendly interface with a start button and an office map for easy navigation. 

  test the app on various devices to ensure functionality and bug-free experience. 

&#x200B;

Considerations for using headsets part  Headsets offer a more immersive experience but can be more expensive than smartphones due to additional hardware and software requirements you can check out any VR agency who can provide you in less cost.

&#x200B;

Using a development platform like Unity or Vuforia streamlines the process, making it faster to create and release your AR app.
